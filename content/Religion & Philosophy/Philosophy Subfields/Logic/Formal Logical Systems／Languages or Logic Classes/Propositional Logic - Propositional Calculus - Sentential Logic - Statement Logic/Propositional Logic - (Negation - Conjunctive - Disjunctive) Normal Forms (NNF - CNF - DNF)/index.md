- <strong>literal</strong> - is an atomic formula or its negation
- <strong>maxterm</strong> - is a literal or a <strong>disjunction</strong> of literals
- <strong>minterm</strong> - is a literal or a <strong>conjunction</strong> of literals

### Types of Normal Forms

```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      {
        "content": "Types",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      {
        "content": "Description",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      }
    ],
    [
      "Negation Normal Form (NNF)",
      "a formula where:\n- the only <em>logical connectives</em> allowed are <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>, and <em>not</em>\n- not is only applied to atomic formulae"
    ],
    [
      "Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF)",
      "a formulae that is a conjunction of maxterms/disjunctions"
    ],
    [
      "Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF)",
      "a formulae that is a disjunction of minterms/conjunctions"
    ]
  ]
}
```

### Translation to Normal Form

- <strong>Translation to NNF</strong>
  - remove ↔  and →
    - A ↔ B ≃ (A → B) and (B → A)
    - A → B ≃ ¬A or B
  - push negations in until they apply only to atomic literals
    - ¬¬A ≃ A
    - ¬(A and B) ≃ ¬A or ¬B
    - ¬(A or B) ≃ ¬A and ¬B
  - at this point the formula is in Negation Normal Form
- <strong>Translation to CNF from NNF</strong>
  - push disjunctions (or) in until they apply only to literals
    - A or (B and C) ≃ (A or B) and (A or C)
  - delete any maxterm that contains both P and ¬P since it is equivalent to <em>true</em>
  - delete any maxterm that includes another maxterm
    - A and (A or B) ≃ A
  - take 2 maxterms of the form below
    - (P or A) and (¬P or A) ≃ A
- <strong>Translation to DNF from NNF</strong>
  - push conjunctions (and) in until they apply only to literals
    - A and (B or C) ≃ (A and B) or (A and C)
  - exactly the same simplifications can be performed for DNF as for CNF, exchanging the roles of <em>∧</em> and <em>v</em>
