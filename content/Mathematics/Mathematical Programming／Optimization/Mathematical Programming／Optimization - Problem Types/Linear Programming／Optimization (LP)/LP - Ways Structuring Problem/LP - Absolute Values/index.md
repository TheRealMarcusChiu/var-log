# <strong>Constraint Functions</strong>

Linear constraints are of the form: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + ... ≤ maximum</code><br><code>a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + ... ≥ minimum</code></span>

Where minimum and maximum are constants.

lp\_solve can only handle these kind of Linear equations. So what if absolute values must be formulated: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>abs(a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3) = 0</code><br><code>abs(a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3) ≤ maximum</code><br><code>abs(a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3) ≥ minimum</code></span>

###### = 0 (or <= 0)

This is the easiest case. If abs(X) must be equal to zero, then this can only be fulfilled if X is zero. So the condition can also be written as: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 = 0</code></span>

###### <= maximum

If X is positive, then -X is negative and thus always less than maximum (which is always positive, remember) and thus the second equation is then redundant. If X is negative, then it is always less than maximum (which is always positive, remember) and thus the first equation is then redundant. This can also be seen easily from the graphical representation. So just add the following two equations: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code> X ≤ maximum</code><br><code>-X ≤ maximum</code></span>

Because of tolerances, B may not be zero, but actually for example 1e-20. This multiplied with 1e30 gives not zero, but 1e10! This results in X + 1e10 ≥ minimum instead of X ≥ minimum.

# <strong>Objective Function</strong>

The objective function is of the form: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>min or max: a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + ...</code></span>

What if there is an absolute value in the objective: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>abs(a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3) + a4 x4 + a5 x5</code></span>

Let's first represent a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 by X and a4 x4 + a5 x5 by Y. Then the objective becomes: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>abs(X) + Y</code></span>

Depending on the sign before the abs and the objective direction, there is an easy and a harder way to solve this.

###### minimization and sign is positive or maximization and sign is negative

<span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>min: abs(X) + Y</code><br><code>or</code><br><code>max: -abs(X) + Y</code></span>

> In these two situations, abs(X) will be as small as possible, ideally zero. We can use that fact. Add one variable X' and two constraints to the model: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code> X ≤ X'</code><br><code>-X ≤ X'</code></span>
>
> And replace in the objective abs(X) with X': <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>min: X' + Y</code><br><code>or</code><br><code>max: -X' + Y</code></span>
>
> That is all. So how does this work? There are 3 cases to consider:
>
> ###### X > 0
>
> In this case, -X is negative and the second constraint -X ≤ X' is always fulfilled because X' is implicitly ≥ 0. The first constraint X ≤ X' is however different. Because X is positive, X' must be at least as large as X. But because X' is in the objective in such a way that is tends to be as small as possible, X' will be equal to X. So X' is abs(X) in this case.

> In this case, X is negative and the first constraint X ≤ X' is always fulfilled because X' is implicitly ≥ 0. The second constraint -X ≤ X' is however different. Because X is negative (-X positive), X' must be at least as large as -X. But because X' is in the objective in such a way that is tends to be as small as possible, X' will be equal to -X.
