# Markov Property in Stochastic Processes

- <strong>Markov Property</strong> refers to the memory-less property of a [[Stochastic／Random／Markov Models／Process|stochastic process]]
  - <strong>First-Order Markov Property</strong> - probability of an observation at time 𝑡 only depends on the observation at time 𝑡-1
  - <strong>Second-Order Markov Property</strong> - probability of an observation at time 𝑡 depend on both 𝑡-1 and 𝑡-2
  - <strong>N<sup>th</sup>-Order Markov Property</strong> - probability of an observation at time 𝑡 depend on all {𝑡-1, ..., 𝑡-𝑛}

# Markov Property in Bayesian Networks

- <strong>Markov Condition/Assumption</strong> that every node in a [[Bayesian Networks (BN)|Bayesian Network]] is [[Probability Independence (Marginal Independence - Conditional Independence)|conditionally independent]] of its non-descendents, given its parents
- <strong>Causal Markov Condition (CMC) </strong>states that, conditional on the set of all its direct causes, a node is independent of all variables which are not direct causes or direct effects of that node

The 2 conditions are equivalent, iff the structure of a Bayesian Network accurately depicts [[Causality (Necessary - Sufficient - Contributory)|causality]]. However, a network may accurately embody the Markov Condition without depicting causality, in which case it should not be assumed to embody the Causal Markov Condition

The Global Markov Property is stronger than the Local Markov Property, which in turn is stronger than the Pairwise Markov Property. However, the above three Markov Properties are equivalent for a positive probability
