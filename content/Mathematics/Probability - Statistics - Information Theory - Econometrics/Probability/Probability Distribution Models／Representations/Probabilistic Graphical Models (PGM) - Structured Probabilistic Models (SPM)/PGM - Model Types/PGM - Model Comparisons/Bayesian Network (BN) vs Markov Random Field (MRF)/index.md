```excerpt
A [[Markov Networks／Nets - Markov Random Fields (MRF)|Markov Network (MN)]] is similar to a [[Bayesian Networks (BN)|Bayesian Network (BN)]] in its representation of independences and dependencies; the differences being that Bayesian networks are directed and acyclic, whereas Markov networks are undirected and may be cyclic. Thus, a Markov network can represent certain independencies and dependencies that a Bayesian network cannot (such as cyclic dependencies); on the other hand, it can't represent certain dependencies that a Bayesian network can (such as induced dependencies)

more difference described here: [[Bayesian Network (BN) vs Markov Random Field (MRF)]]

### Converting Between BN & MN

When converting a BN to a MN, the MN dependencies MUST be a superset of the BN dependencies:

> [!indent]
> I(Bayes) ⊆ I(Markov)

When converting a MN to a BN, the BN dependencies MUST be a superset of the MN dependencies:

> [!indent]
> I(Markov) ⊆ I(Bayes)

where:

> [!indent]
> I(..) are [[I-Map - D-Map - Minimal I-Map - Maximal D-Map - P-Map - I-Equivalence|I-Maps]]

conversions:

- [[BN - To Markov Network]]
- [[MN／MRF - To Bayesian Network|MN/MRF - To Bayesian Network]]
