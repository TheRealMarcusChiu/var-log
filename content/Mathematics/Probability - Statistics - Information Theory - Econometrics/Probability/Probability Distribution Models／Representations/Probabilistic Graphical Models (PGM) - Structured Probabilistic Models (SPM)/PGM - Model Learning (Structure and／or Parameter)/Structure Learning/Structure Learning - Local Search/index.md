- start with a random structure and compute its score
- generate all local structures of current structure:
  - structures are local by doing 1 of the following to the current structure:
    - add edge
    - remove edge
    - reverse edge
- for each local structure compute its score
- choose structure with highest score
- repeat until convergence
