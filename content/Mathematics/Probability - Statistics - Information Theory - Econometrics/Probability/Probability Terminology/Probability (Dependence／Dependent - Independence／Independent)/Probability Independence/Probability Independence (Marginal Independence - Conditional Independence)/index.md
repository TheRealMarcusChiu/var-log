# Marginal Independence (Independence)

Two random variables are <strong>independent</strong>, <strong>statistically independent</strong>, <strong>marginally independent</strong>, or <strong>stochastically independent</strong> if the realization of one does not affect the probability distribution of the other

the following implies each other:
1. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐴 and 𝐵 are Independent</font>
2. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐴 ⊥ 𝐵</font>
3. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐏(𝐴,𝐵) = 𝐏(𝐴)𝐏(𝐵)</font>
4. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐏(𝐴|𝐵) = 𝐏(𝐴)</font>
5. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐏(𝐵|𝐴) = 𝐏(𝐵)</font>

with equation 3 we can derive equation 2 and equation 4 as shown below:
```
𝐏(𝐴|𝐵)          = 𝐏(𝐴)      # equation 3
𝐏(𝐴|𝐵)𝐏(𝐵)      = 𝐏(𝐴)𝐏(𝐵)
𝐏(𝐴,𝐵)          = 𝐏(𝐴)𝐏(𝐵)  # equation 2
𝐏(𝐵|𝐴)𝐏(𝐴)      = 𝐏(𝐴)𝐏(𝐵)
𝐏(𝐵|𝐴)          = 𝐏(𝐵)      # equation 4
```
# Conditional Independence
The following implies each other:
1. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐴 and 𝐵 are Conditionally Independent when given 𝐶</font>
2. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐴 ⊥ 𝐵 | 𝐶</font>
3. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐏(𝐴,𝐵|𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴|𝐶)𝐏(𝐵|𝐶)</font>
4. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐏(𝐴,𝐵|𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴|𝐵,𝐶)𝐏(𝐵|𝐴,𝐶)</font>
5. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐏(𝐴|𝐵,𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴|𝐶)</font>
6. <font style="color: rgb(128,0,0);">𝐏(𝐵|𝐴,𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐵|𝐶)</font>

with equation 2 we can derive equation 4 as shown below:
```
𝐏(𝐴,𝐵|𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴,𝐵,𝐶)          / 𝐏(𝐶)
𝐏(𝐴,𝐵|𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴|𝐵,𝐶) * 𝐏(𝐵,𝐶) / 𝐏(𝐶)
𝐏(𝐴,𝐵|𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴|𝐵,𝐶) * 𝐏(𝐵|𝐶)
𝐏(𝐴,𝐵|𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴|𝐶)   * 𝐏(𝐵|𝐶)
therefore
𝐏(𝐴|𝐵,𝐶) = 𝐏(𝐴|𝐶)
```
###### Formal Definition
two random events 𝐴 and 𝐵 are <strong>conditionally independent</strong> given a third event 𝐶 precisely if the occurrence of 𝐴 and the occurrence of 𝐵 are independent events in their [[Probability Independence (Marginal Independence - Conditional Independence)|conditional probability distribution]] given 𝐶. In other words, 𝐴 and 𝐵 are conditionally independent given 𝐶 if and only if, given knowledge that 𝐶 occurs, knowledge of whether 𝐴 occurs provides no information on the likelihood of 𝐵 occurring, and knowledge of whether 𝐵 occurs provides no information on the likelihood of 𝐴 occurring
