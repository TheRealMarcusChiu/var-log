###### Gradient Computation Algorithms - Algorithms Computing Gradients

```excerpt
- is any algorithm that computes the [[Derivative of Scalar-Valued Function (Partial Derivative - Total Derivative - Gradient - Directional Directive - Second Order Partial Derivative)|gradient]] of a [[Explicit Differentiation／Derivative／Differentiable／Differential Functions (differentiable at a point - differentiable over an interval - differentiable everywhere／over the entire domain)|differentiable function]] (often the [[Objective Function／Criterion - Cost／Loss／Error Function - Expected Cost／Loss／Error|loss function]])
- the gradients computed can be used for the [[Gradient Descent／Ascent Algorithms - The Method of Steepest Descent／Ascent Algorithms|gradient descent algorithm]]

# Gradient Computation - Types Comparisons

- Symbolic Differentiation faces the difficulty of converting a computer program into a single mathematical expression and can lead to inefficient code
- Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences) can introduce round-off errors in the discretization process and cancellation

Both symbolic and numerical differentiation:

- have problems with calculating higher derivatives, where complexity and errors increase
- are slow at computing partial derivatives of a function with respect to many inputs, as is needed for gradient-based optimization algorithms

Automatic differentiation solves all of these problems.

# Gradient Computation - Other Types

- <strong>[[Batch Gradient Estimation - Stochastic Gradient Estimation - Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation|Batch Gradient Estimation]]</strong> - approximates the true gradients using the <strong>ENTIRE</strong> training set
- <strong>[[Batch Gradient Estimation - Stochastic Gradient Estimation - Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation|Stochastic Gradient Estimation]]</strong> - approximates the true gradients using a <strong>SINGLE</strong> element of the training set
- <strong>[[Batch Gradient Estimation - Stochastic Gradient Estimation - Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation|Mini-Batch Gradient Estimation]]</strong> - approximates the true gradients using a <strong>SUBSET</strong> of the training set
- <strong>Hessian Matrix Approximation</strong> - the [[Hessian／Hesse Matrix|Hessian matrix]] contains second-order derivatives and provides additional information about the curvature of the loss function. Techniques like finite differences, the Gauss-Newton method, or the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm can be used to approximate the Hessian matrix and compute gradients more accurately.
