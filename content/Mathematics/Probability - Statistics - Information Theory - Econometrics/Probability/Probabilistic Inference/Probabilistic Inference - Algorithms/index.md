# Algorithms in Solving a Probability Query
````excerpt
In practice, the exact inference method is not used widely, and most probabilistic inference algorithms are approximate. Nevertheless, it is important to understand exact inference and its limitations
- [[Probabilistic Inference - Exact Inference|Exact Inference Algorithms]] - intractable ([[P - NP - NPC - NPI - NPO - NPH|NP-Hard]]) in the general case
- [[Probabilistic Inference - Approximate Inference|Approximate Inference Algorithms]] ([[Inferential Statistics]]) - tractable method, though the loss of exactness

sometimes exact, sometimes approximate algorithms
- [[Probabilistic Inference - Message Passing - Belief Propagation - Sum-Product Algorithm|Message Passing - Belief Propagation Algorithm]] - exact in trees, approximate in graphs with cycles
