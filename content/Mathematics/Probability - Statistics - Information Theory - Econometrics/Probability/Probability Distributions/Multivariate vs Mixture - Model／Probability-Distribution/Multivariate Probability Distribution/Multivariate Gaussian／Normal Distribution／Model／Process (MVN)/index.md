<strong>Multivariate Gaussian/Normal Distribution (MVN)</strong>
- is a type of [[Multivariate Probability Distribution|multivariate probability distribution]]
- is a type of [[Gaussian／Normal Distribution／Model／Process|Gaussian/Normal Distribution/Model/Process]]
- not to be confused with [[Gaussian／Normal Mixture Distribution／Model／Process (GMM／NMM) - Bimodal／Trimodal／Multimodal|Gaussian/Normal Mixture Distribution/Model/Process (GMM/NMM)]]
- is a generalization of the [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|one-dimensional (univariate) normal distribution]] to higher dimensions
- is often used to approximate any set of (possibly) correlated real-valued random variables each of which clusters around a mean value

# MVN - Probability Density Function

A multivariate normal distribution is where each random variable is normally distributed and their joint distribution is also normal.

The multivariate normal distribution is defined by:
- mean vector 𝝁
- [[Covariance & Correlation Matrix|covariance matrix]] 𝚺

Visually, the multivariate normal distribution is:
- centered around the mean 𝝁
- its shape is defined by the covariance matrix 𝚺

### Covariance Matrix Types

> [!expand-ui]- Non-Degenerate Case
> The multivariate normal distribution is said to be "non-degenerate" when the symmetric [[Covariance & Correlation Matrix|covariance matrix]] is [[Positive／Negative Definite／Semi-Definite Indefinite Matrix|positive definite]]. In this case, the distribution has a [[Probability Distribution - Continuous Functions／Models (Probability Density Functions)|density]]
