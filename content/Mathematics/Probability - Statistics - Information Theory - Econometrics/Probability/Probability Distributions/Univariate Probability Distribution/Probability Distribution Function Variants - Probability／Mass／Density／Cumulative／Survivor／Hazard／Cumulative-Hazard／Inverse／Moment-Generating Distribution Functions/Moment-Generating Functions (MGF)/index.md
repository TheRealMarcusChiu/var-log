###### Moment-Generating Functions (MGF)

```excerpt
- is an alternative specification of a real-valued random variable's probability distribution
- Not all random variables have an MGF
- As its name implies, the MGF can be used to compute a distribution’s moments: the 𝑛<sup>th</sup> [[Raw Moments - Moments About the Origin／Zero - Central／Mean Moments - Moments About The Mean - (Zeroth／First／Second／Third／Fourth／kth／nth) -  of a Probability Density Function|moment about 0]] is the 𝑛<sup>th</sup> [[Differential Calculus|derivative]] of the MGF evaluated at 0

# MGF - Definition

The MGF of a random variable 𝑋 is defined as:

- $M_X(t) = 𝐄[e^{tX}] = \begin{cases} \sum_{x \in X} e^{tx} P_X(x)     & X \text{ is discrete} \\ \int_{-∞}^∞    e^{tx} f_X(x) dx  & X \text{ is continuous} \\ \end{cases}$

Provided the [[Arithmetic Mean - Average - Location - Expected Value - Expectation Operator|expectation]] 𝐄 exists for some 𝑡 in a [[Mathematical Space (Neighborhoods)|neighborhood]] of 0.

# MGF - Using MGF to Calculate Moments

The [[Raw Moments - Moments About the Origin／Zero - Central／Mean Moments - Moments About The Mean - (Zeroth／First／Second／Third／Fourth／kth／nth) -  of a Probability Density Function|𝑛th moment]] of random variable 𝑋 denoted as 𝐄\[𝑋<sup>𝑛</sup>] is defined as the 𝑛<sup>th</sup> derivative of the MGF of 𝑋 evaluated at 𝑡=0:

- $𝐄[X^n] = \frac{d^n}{dt^n}M_X(t) |_{t=0}$

# MGF - Algebra

If the MGF of 𝑋  is 𝑀<sub>𝑋</sub>(𝑡), then the MGF of 𝑎𝑋+𝑏 is 𝑒<sup>𝑏𝑡</sup>𝑀<sub>𝑋</sub>(𝑎𝑡)
