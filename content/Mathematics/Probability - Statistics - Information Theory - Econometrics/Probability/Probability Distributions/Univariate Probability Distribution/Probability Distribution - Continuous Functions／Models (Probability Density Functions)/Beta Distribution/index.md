###### Beta Distribution

```excerpt
- is a family of [[Probability Distribution - Continuous Functions／Models (Probability Density Functions)|continuous probability distributions]] defined on the interval \[0, 1\] parametrized by two positive shape parameters, 𝛼 and 𝛽, that control the shape of the distribution.
- the generalization to multiple variables is called a [[Multivariate Beta Distribution (MBD) - Dirichlet Distribution|Dirichlet Distribution]]
```

^excerpt

# Probability Density Function

- 𝑓(𝑥) = (1 - 𝑥)<sup>𝛽-1</sup>𝑥<sup>𝛼-1</sup>/ 𝐵(𝛼,𝛽)

where:

- 𝐵(𝛼,𝛽) is the beta function, i.e.:
  - 𝐵(𝛼,𝛽) = \[𝛤(𝛼)𝛤(𝛽)] / 𝛤(𝛼+𝛽)
  - 𝐵(𝛼,𝛽) = \[(𝛼-1)!(𝛽-1)!] / (𝛼+𝛽-1)!

where:

- 𝛤 is the [[Gamma Function|gamma function]], i.e. 𝛤(𝑛) = (𝑛 - 1)!
