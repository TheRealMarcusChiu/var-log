# Example

A new computer virus attacks a folder consisting of 200 files. Each file gets damaged with a probability of 0.2 independently of other files. What is the probability that fewer than 50 files get damaged

The number 𝑋 of damaged files has a Binomial distribution with:

- 𝑛 = 200
- 𝑝 = 0.2
- 𝜇 = 𝑛𝑝 = 40
- 𝜎 = √\[𝑛𝑝(1 − 𝑝)] = 5.657

Applying the [[Central Limit Theorem (CLT)|Central Limit Theorem]] with the continuity correction

Notice that the properly applied continuity correction replaces 50 with 49.5, not 50.5. Indeed, we are interested in the event that 𝑋 is strictly less than 50. This includes all values up to 49 and corresponds to the interval \[0, 49] that we expand to \[0, 49.5]. In other words, events {𝑋 < 50} and {𝑋 < 49.5} are the same; they include the same possible values of 𝑋. Events {𝑋 < 50} and {𝑋 < 50.5} are different because the former includes 𝑋 = 50, and the latter does not. Replacing {𝑋 < 50} with {𝑋 < 50.5} would have changed its probability and would have given a wrong answer
