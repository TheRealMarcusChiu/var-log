This is why \"P = NP?\" is such a famous question.\n- Example\n\t- 3-SAT. This is the problem wherein we are given conjunction (ANDs) of 3-clause disjunctions (ORs), statements of the form\n\t\t- (x<sub>11</sub> OR x<sub>21</sub> OR x<sub>31</sub>) AND\n\t\t- (x<sub>12</sub> OR x<sub>22</sub> OR x<sub>32</sub>) AND\n\t\t- ... AND\n\t\t- (x<sub>1n</sub> OR x<sub>2n</sub> OR x<sub>3n</sub>)\n\t- where each x<sub>ij</sub> is a boolean variable or the negation of a variable from a finite predefined list (x<sub>1</sub>, x<sub>2</sub>, ..., x<sub>n</sub>).\n\t- It can be shown that every NP problem can be reduced to 3-SAT. The proof of this is technical and requires the use of the technical definition of NP (based on non-deterministic Turing machines). This is known as Cook's theorem.",

That is the NP in NP-hard does not mean non-deterministic polynomial time. Yes, this is confusing, but its usage is entrenched and unlikely to change\n- since any NP-complete problem can be reduced to any other NP-complete problem in polynomial time, all NP-complete problems can be reduced to any NP-hard problem in polynomial time. Then, if there is a solution to one NP-hard problem in polynomial time, there is a solution to all NP problems in polynomial time\n- Example\n\t- The halting problem is an NP-hard problem. This is the problem that given a program P and input I, will it halt? This is a decision problem but it is not in NP. It is clear that any NP-complete problem can be reduced to this one.
