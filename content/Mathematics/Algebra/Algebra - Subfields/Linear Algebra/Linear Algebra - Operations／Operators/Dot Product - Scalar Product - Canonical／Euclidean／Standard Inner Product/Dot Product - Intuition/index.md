Say what want the dot product of \[3,4] and \[3,2]

The vector \[3,2] can be decomposed into 2 vectors each along the axis:

- \[3,2] = \[3,0] + \[0,2]

Applying a linear transformation T on \[3,2] is the same as applying the same transformation individually on each of the 2 decomposed vectors. This is because of the first law of linear transformations:

- T(\[3,0]) + T(\[0,2]) = T(\[3,2])

Let T be the 1 by 2 matrix \[3,4] that linearly transforms a 2D vector into a 1D vector scalar. Thus:

- T(\[3,0]) = 9
- T(\[0,2]) = 8
- T(\[3,2]) = 17

This aligns with the equation pitched above

T(\[3,0]) and T(\[0,2]) have a nice geometric view. T projects any vector onto itself and multiplies it by T's magnitude (which is nicely explained in the video
