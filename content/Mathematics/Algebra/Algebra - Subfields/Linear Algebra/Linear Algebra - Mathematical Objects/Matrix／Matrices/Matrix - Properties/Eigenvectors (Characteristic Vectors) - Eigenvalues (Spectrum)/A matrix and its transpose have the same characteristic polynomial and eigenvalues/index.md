# Fact

Matrix 𝐴 and its [[Transpose Matrix - Complex-Conjugate／Hermitian／Adjoint／Transjugate／Bedaggered Transpose Matrix|transpose]] 𝐴<sup>𝑇</sup> have the same:

- [[Characteristic Polynomial|characteristic polynomial]]
- [[Eigenvectors (Characteristic Vectors) - Eigenvalues (Spectrum)|eigenvalues]]

# Proof - Same Characteristic Polynomial

The characteristic polynomial of 𝐴 is defined as:

- 𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡(𝐴 - 𝜆𝐼)

The determinant of a matrix and its transpose are the same ([[Determinants - Invertible／Non-Singular - Not-Invertible／Singular|see here]]). Thus:

- 𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡(𝐴 - 𝜆𝐼) = 𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡((𝐴 - 𝜆𝐼)<sup>𝑇</sup>)

Simplifying the right-hand side yields:

- 𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡(𝐴 - 𝜆𝐼) = 𝑑𝑒𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑛𝑡(𝐴<sup>𝑇</sup> - 𝜆𝐼)

The characteristic polynomial defined on the right is of 𝐴<sup>𝑇</sup>

# Proof - Same Eigenvalues

Since both 𝐴 and 𝐴<sup>𝑇</sup>have the same characteristic polynomial. They necessarily have the same eigenvalues.
