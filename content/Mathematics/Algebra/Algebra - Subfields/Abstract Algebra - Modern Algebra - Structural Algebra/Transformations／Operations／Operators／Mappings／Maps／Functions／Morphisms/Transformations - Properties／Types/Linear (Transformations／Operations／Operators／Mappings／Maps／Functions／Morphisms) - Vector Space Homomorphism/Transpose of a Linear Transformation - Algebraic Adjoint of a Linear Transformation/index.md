###### Transpose of a Linear Transformation - Algebraic Adjoint of a Linear Transformation

```excerpt
- the <strong>transpose</strong> takes as input a linear transformation 𝐿 and converts it into another linear transformation 𝐿<sup>T</sup>
- any [[Linear (Transformations／Operations／Operators／Mappings／Maps／Functions／Morphisms) - Vector Space Homomorphism|linear transformation (𝐿 : 𝑉→𝑊)]] between two [[Vector Spaces - Linear Spaces|vector spaces (𝑉,𝑊)]] over the same [[Fields (Algebraic Structure) - Field Theory|field (𝐹)]] induces a linear transformation 𝐿<sup>T</sup>: 𝑊<sup>∗</sup>→𝑉<sup>∗</sup> between two [[Dual Spaces - Algebraic Dual Spaces - Dual Vector Spaces|dual vector spaces (𝑉∗,𝑊∗)]]
	- 𝐿<sup>T</sup> is the <strong>transpose</strong> of 𝐿
- if the linear transformation 𝐿 is represented by a matrix 𝐴, then the <strong>transpose</strong> of this linear transformation 𝐿<sup>T</sup> is represented by the [[Transpose Matrix - Complex-Conjugate／Hermitian／Adjoint／Transjugate／Bedaggered Transpose Matrix|Transpose Matrix (𝐴T)]]

# Transpose - Definition

Let 𝐿: 𝑉→𝑊 be a linear transformation. The transpose of 𝐿 is defined as:

- 𝐿<sup>T</sup>: 𝑊<sup>∗</sup>→𝑉<sup>∗</sup>

Where 𝐿<sup>T</sup>'s:

- INPUT is a linear functional 𝑓 ∊ 𝑊<sup>∗</sup> (where 𝑓: 𝑊→𝐹)
- OUTPUT is a linear functional 𝐿<sup>T</sup>(𝑓) ∊ 𝑉<sup>∗</sup> (where 𝐿<sup>T</sup>(𝑓): 𝑉→𝐹)

Thus when given any vector 𝑣∊𝑉:

- 𝐿<sup>T</sup>(𝑓)(𝑣) = 𝑓(𝐿(𝑣))

# Transpose - Properties

- given a finite [[Linear (Transformations／Operations／Operators／Mappings／Maps／Functions／Morphisms) - Vector Space Homomorphism|linear transformation (𝐿 : ℝ𝑛→ℝ𝑛)]] and a [[Dot Product - Scalar Product - Canonical／Euclidean／Standard Inner Product|standard inner product]] (⟨·,·⟩)
  , we have

⟨𝐿𝑥,𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑥,𝐿<sup>T</sup>𝑦⟩

- if 𝐿 is also an [[Orthogonal／Orthonormal／Unitary (Transformations／Operations／Operators／Mappings／Maps／Functions)|orthogonal transformation]], 𝐿 preserves the inner product between 2 vectors 𝑥 and 𝑦:
  - ⟨𝑥,𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝐴𝑥,𝐴𝑦⟩ = ⟨𝑥,𝐴<sup>T</sup>𝐴𝑦⟩ and we find that 𝐴<sup>T</sup>𝐴 = 𝐼 and 𝐴<sup>-1</sup> = 𝐴<sup>T</sup>
