###### Compactness/Compact

- is a property that seeks to generalize the notion of [[Mathematical Space (Open Sets - Closed Sets - Clopen Sets)|closed]] subset and [[Metric Spaces (Epsilon Balls - Open Sets - Boundary Points／Sets - Closed Sets - Closures - Bounded Sets ／ Boundedness - Unbounded Sets ／ Unboundedness - Totally Bounded Sets ／ Totally Boundedness)|totally bounded]] subset of [[Euclidean Vector Spaces - Euclidean Spaces|Euclidean space]]
- the idea is that a <em>compact space</em> has no "punctures" nor "missing endpoints" (i.e. it includes all [[Mathematical Space (Limit Points - Accumulation Points - Cluster Points)|limiting values]] of points)
- a set/space 𝑋 is <strong>compact</strong> if every [[Mathematical Space (Cover／Covering - Open Cover／Covering - Subcover／Subcovering)|open cover]] of 𝑋 has a finite [[Mathematical Space (Cover／Covering - Open Cover／Covering - Subcover／Subcovering)|subcover]]
- a subset 𝑌 of a set/space 𝑋 is <strong>compact</strong> if every open cover of 𝑌 has a finite subcover

###### Sequential Compactness - Sequentially Compact

- a set 𝑋 is <em>sequentially compact</em> if every sequence of points in 𝑋 has a <em>convergent subsequence</em> converging to a point in 𝑋

###### Limit Point Compactness - Weakly Countably Compact

- a set 𝑋 is <em>weakly countably compact</em> if every infinite subset of 𝑋 has a [[Mathematical Space (Limit Points - Accumulation Points - Cluster Points)|limit point]] in 𝑋
- this property generalizes a property of [[Compact Spaces - Compact Set - Compact Subspace|compact spaces]]

###### Countable Compactness - Countably Compact

- a set 𝑋 is <em>countably compact</em> if every countable [[Mathematical Space (Cover／Covering - Open Cover／Covering - Subcover／Subcovering)|open cover]] has a finite [[Mathematical Space (Cover／Covering - Open Cover／Covering - Subcover／Subcovering)|subcover]]

# Compactness - Other

- for [[Metric Spaces|metric spaces]]; <em>compactness</em>, <em>limit point compactness</em>, and <em>sequential compactness</em> are ALL equivalent
- for [[Topological Spaces|topological spaces]]; <em>compactness</em>, <em>limit point compactness</em>, and <em>sequential compactness</em> are NOT equivalent

# Compactness - Examples & Non-Examples

- the open interval (0,1) is <strong><em>not</em> <em>compact</em></strong> because it excludes the limiting values of 0 and 1
- the closed interval \[0,1] is <strong><em>compact</em></strong>
- the space of [[Numbers Classes／Classification of Numbers|rational numbers (ℚ)]] is <strong><em>not</em> <em>compact</em></strong> because it has infinitely many "punctures" corresponding to the irrational numbers
- the space of [[Real Numbers System|real numbers (ℝ)]] is <strong><em>not</em> <em>compact</em></strong> because it excludes the two limiting values +∞ and -∞
- the [extended real number line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_numbers) would be <strong><em>compact</em></strong> because it contains both infinities
- the entire [[Euclidean Vector Spaces - Euclidean Spaces|Euclidean space]] of any dimension is <strong><em>not</em> <em>compact</em></strong> since it is not [[Mathematical Space (Bounded Sets - Unbounded Sets)|bounded]]
- any subset (subspaces) of [[Euclidean Vector Spaces - Euclidean Spaces|Euclidean space]] is <strong><em>compact</em></strong> if and only if it is both [[Mathematical Space (Open Sets - Closed Sets - Clopen Sets)|closed]] and [[Mathematical Space (Bounded Sets - Unbounded Sets)|bounded]]

###### Relatively Compact Subspace/Subset - Precompact Subspace/Subset

- a subset 𝑆 of a [[Mathematical Spaces|mathematical space (𝑋)]] is called a <em>relatively compact subspace</em> if its [[Mathematical Space (Closures - Spans - Generated Sets)|closure]] is <em>compact</em>
