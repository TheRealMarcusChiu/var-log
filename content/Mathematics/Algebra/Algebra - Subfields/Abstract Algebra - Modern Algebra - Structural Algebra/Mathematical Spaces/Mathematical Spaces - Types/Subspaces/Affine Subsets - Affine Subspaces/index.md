###### Affine Subsets

- is the sum of a vector and a linear subspace
- given a [[Vector Spaces - Linear Spaces|vector space]] 𝑉, a [[Linear Subspaces - Vector Subspaces|linear subspace]] 𝑆 of 𝑉, and a [[Vectors|vector]] 𝑣∊𝑉; an <em>affine subset</em> of 𝑉 is defined as: 𝑣 + 𝑆
- affine subset 𝑣 + 𝑆 is a translation of 𝑆 by 𝑣
- affine subsets are related to [[Cosets|cosets]]
- no <em>affine subsets</em> are linear subspaces unless 𝑣 is the zero vector

###### Affine Subspaces

- is an <em>affine subset</em> where 𝑣 is the zero vector
- all <em>affine subspaces</em> are [[Linear Subspaces - Vector Subspaces|linear subspaces]]
