###### Cosine Similarity

- a type of [[Similarity Measures／Metrics／Semi-Metrics／Functions|Similarity Measure]] that measures the similarity (or angle) between 2 [[Vectors|vectors]]
- the similarity is scored between an [[Real Intervals (Empty／Degenerate／Proper／Bounded／Finite／Half-Bounded／Unbounded／Left／Right／Open／Closed Intervals)|interval]] \[-1, 1]:
  - proportional vectors have a cosine similarity of 1
  - orthogonal vectors have a cosine similarity of 0 (see [[Why Dot Product of 2 Orthogonal Vectors Equals Zero？ (Cosine Similarity)|proof]])
  - opposite vectors have a cosine similarity of -1
- when dealing with positive-only vectors, the similarity is scored between an interval \[0, 1]
