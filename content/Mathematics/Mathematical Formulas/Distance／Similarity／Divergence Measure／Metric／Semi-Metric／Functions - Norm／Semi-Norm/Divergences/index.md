# Divergence - Definition

Given a [[Differentiable／Differential Manifold|differentiable manifold (𝑀)]] of dimension 𝑛, a <em>divergence</em> on 𝑀 is a [[C0 Functions - C1 Functions - C2 Functions - Ck Functions|𝐶2-function]] 𝐷: 𝑀 × 𝑀 → \[0,∞) satisfying:

1. 𝐷(𝑝,𝑞) ≥ 0 for all 𝑝,𝑞∈𝑀 (non-negativity)
2. 𝐷(𝑝,𝑞) = 0 if and only if 𝑝=𝑞 (positivity)
3. At every point, 𝑝∈𝑀, 𝐷(𝑝,𝑝+𝑑𝑝) is a [[Positive／Negative Semi Definite／Definiteness Indefinite Functions|positive-definite]] [[Quadratic Forms|quadratic form]] for infinitesimal displacements 𝑑𝑝 from 𝑝

Statistics and probability generally only require conditions 1 and 2. In information geometry, condition 3 is also required.

As an example, the [[Total Variation Distance|total variation distance]], a commonly used statistical divergence, does not satisfy condition 3.
