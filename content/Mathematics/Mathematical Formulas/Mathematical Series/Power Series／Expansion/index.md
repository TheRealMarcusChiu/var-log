# Power Series - Definition

A <strong>power series</strong> (in one variable 𝑥) is an infinite series of the form:

> [!indent]
> ![[Power Series／Expansion/power-series-formula.png|350]]

where:
- 𝑥 is the input variable
- 𝑎<sub>𝑛</sub> represents the coefficient of the 𝑛<sup>th</sup> term
- 𝑐 is a constant

# Power Series - Non-Examples

Power series does NOT permit:
- <strong>negative powers</strong> - for instance, 1 + 𝑥<sup>-1</sup> + 𝑥<sup>-2</sup> + ... is not a power series (it is a [[Laurent Series|Laurent series]])
- <strong>fractional powers</strong> - for instance, 1 + 𝑥<sup>1/2</sup> + 𝑥<sup>2/2</sup> + 𝑥<sup>3/2</sup>+ ... is not a power series (it is a [[Puiseux Series|Puiseux series]])
- <strong>coefficients dependent on 𝑥 </strong>- for an instance, 𝑠𝑖𝑛(𝑥)𝑥 + 𝑠𝑖𝑛(2𝑥)𝑥<sup>2</sup> + 𝑠𝑖𝑛(3𝑥)𝑥<sup>3</sup> +... is not a power series

# Power Series - Polynomial Example

Any polynomial can be easily expressed as a power series around any center 𝑐, although all but finitely many of the coefficients will be zero since a power series has infinitely many terms by definition.

For instance, the polynomial <font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥<sup>2</sup> + 2𝑥 + 3</font> can be written as a power series around the center:
- (𝑐 = 0) as: 𝑓(𝑥) = 3 + 2𝑥 + 1𝑥<sup>2</sup> + 0𝑥<sup>3</sup> + 0𝑥<sup>4</sup> + ...
- (𝑐 = 1) as: 𝑓(𝑥) = 6 + 4(𝑥 - 1) + 1(𝑥 - 1)<sup>2</sup> + 0(𝑥 - 1)<sup>3</sup> + 0(𝑥 - 1)<sup>4</sup> + ...
- or indeed around any other center <em>c</em>

One can view power series as being like "polynomials of infinite degree," although power series are not polynomials
# Power Series - Use Cases & Applications
- occur in [[Combinatorics|combinatorics]] as generating functions (a kind of formal power series)
- occur in electronic engineering (under the name of the Z-transform)
- the familiar [[Base10 - Decimal Notation|decimal notation]] for real numbers can also be viewed as an example of a power series, with integer coefficients, but with the argument 𝑥 fixed at 1⁄10
- occur in [[Number Theory|number theory]], the concept of [[p-adic Numbers - prime-adic Numbers|p-adic numbers]] is also closely related to that of a power series
