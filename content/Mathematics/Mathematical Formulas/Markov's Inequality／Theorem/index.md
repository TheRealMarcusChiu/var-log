###### Markov's Inequality

```excerpt
- in [[Probability Theory|probability theory]], <strong>Markov's Inequality</strong> gives an upper bound on the probability that a non-negative random variable is greater than or equal to some positive constant
```

# Statement

If 𝑋 is a nonnegative random variable and 𝑎>0, then the [[Probability|probability]] that 𝑋 is at least 𝑎 is at most the [[Arithmetic Mean - Average - Location - Expected Value - Expectation Operator|expectation]] of 𝑋 divided by 𝑎:

- 𝐏⁡(𝑋≥𝑎) ≤ 𝐄\[𝑋]/𝑎

Let 𝑎 = 𝑎̃⋅𝐄\[𝑋] where 𝑎̃>0; then we can rewrite the previous inequality as

- 𝐏⁡(𝑋 ≥ 𝑎̃⋅𝐄\[𝑋]) ≤ 1/𝑎̃

In the language of [[Measure Theory|measure theory]], <strong>Markov's inequality</strong> states that if:

- (𝑋, 𝛴, 𝜇) is a [[Measure Spaces|measure space]]
- 𝑓 is a [measurable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Measurable_function) [extended real](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line)-valued function
- 𝜀>0

then:

- $𝜇({x∈X:|f(x)| ≥ 𝜀}) ≤ \frac{1}{𝜀} \int_X |f|d𝜇$

This measure-theoretic definition is sometimes referred to as [[Chebyshev's Inequality／Theorem|Chebyshev's inequality]].
