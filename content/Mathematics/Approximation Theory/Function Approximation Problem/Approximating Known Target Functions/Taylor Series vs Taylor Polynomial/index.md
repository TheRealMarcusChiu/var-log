###### Taylor Series vs Taylor Polynomial
````excerpt
- is a representation of a [[Functions (Domain - Codomain - Preimage - Image - Range)|function]] as a sum of terms that are calculated from the values of the function's [[Explicit Differentiation／Derivative／Differentiable／Differential Functions (differentiable at a point - differentiable over an interval - differentiable everywhere／over the entire domain)|derivatives]] at a single point
	- <strong>Taylor series</strong> is an infinite sum
	- <strong>Taylor polynomial</strong> is a finite sum
- goal is to take a non-polynomial function and represent it as a polynomial function (which is easier to understand and manipulate)
- transforms: derivative information at a point → approximation information near that point

> Again, when you substitute 𝑥 = 0, we get
> - 𝑓'(0) = 𝑎<sub>1</sub>
>
> Therefore,  \[𝑓'(0)/1!\] = 𝑎<sub>1</sub>
>
> So, differentiate it again, we get
> - 𝑓''(𝑥) = 2𝑎<sub>2</sub> + 6𝑎<sub>3</sub>𝑥 + 12𝑎<sub>4</sub>𝑥<sup>2</sup> + …
>
> Now, substitute 𝑥=0 in second-order differentiation, and we get
> - 𝑓''(0) = 2𝑎<sub>2</sub>
>
> Therefore, \[𝑓''(0)/2!\] = 𝑎<sub>2</sub>
>
> By generalizing the equation, we get
> - 𝑓<sup>𝑛</sup>(0)/𝑛! = 𝑎<sub>𝑛</sub>
>
> Now substitute the values in the power series we get,
> - 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑓(0) + 𝑓'(0)𝑥 + \[𝑓''(0)/2!\]𝑥<sup>2</sup>+ \[𝑓'''(0)/3!\]𝑥<sup>3</sup>+ ….
>
> Generalize 𝑓 in a more general form, and it becomes
> - 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑏 + 𝑏<sub>1</sub>(𝑥-𝑎) + 𝑏<sub>2</sub>(𝑥-𝑎)<sup>2</sup> + 𝑏<sub>3</sub>(𝑥-𝑎)<sup>3</sup>+ ….
>
> Now, 𝑥 = 𝑎, we get
> - 𝑏<sub>𝑛</sub> = 𝑓<sup>𝑛</sup>(𝑎)/𝑛!
>
> Now, substitute 𝑏<sub>n</sub> in a generalized form
> - 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑎) + \[𝑓'(𝑎)/1!\](𝑥−𝑎) + \[𝑓''(𝑎)/2!\](𝑥−𝑎)<sup>2</sup>+ \[𝑓'''(𝑎)/3!\](𝑥−𝑎)<sup>3</sup>+ ….
