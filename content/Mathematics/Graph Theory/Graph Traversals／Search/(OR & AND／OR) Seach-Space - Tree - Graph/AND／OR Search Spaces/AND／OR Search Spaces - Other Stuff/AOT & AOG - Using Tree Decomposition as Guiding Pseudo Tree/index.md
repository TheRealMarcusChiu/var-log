this article will go over the creation of

- [[AND／OR Search Trees (AOT)|AND/OR Search Trees (AOT)]]
- [[AND／OR Search Graphs (AOG)|AND/OR Search Graphs (AOG)]] - specifically Context Minimal AND/OR Search Graphs

while using a [[Cluster／Clique／Join／Junction Trees - Tree Decompositions - Tree-Width|tree decomposition]] as the guiding [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|pseudo tree]]

### Example

- we create a [[Cluster／Clique／Join／Junction Trees - Tree Decompositions - Tree-Width|tree decomposition]] of the [[Hypergraphs - Primal Graphs - Dual Graphs - Cluster Graphs - Cluster Trees - Factor Graphs|primal graph]] shown below
- to form a [[Cluster／Clique／Join／Junction Trees - Tree Decompositions - Tree-Width|tree decomposition]] we will use <font style="color: rgb(204,153,255);">purple arrows</font> of the [[Probabilistic Inference - Bucket Elimination (BE) - Variable Elimination (VE)|bucket elimination algorithm]] (note: we don't actually have to execute the bucket elimination algorithm, we are just using intuition of buckets)
- the tree decomposition is a valid guiding [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|pseudo tree]] for creating an AOT

- the AOT is shown below (assume each variable A, ..., F has domain {0, 1})

- to turn the [[AND／OR Search Trees (AOT)|AND/OR Search Tree]] into a [[AND／OR Search Graphs (AOG)|Context Minimal AND/OR Search Graph]] we will need to know to contexts of each variable (A, ..., F)
- we do this by forming an [[(Ordered Graph - Width) - (Induced Graph - Induced Width) - (Conditional Induced Graph - Conditional Induced Width)|induced graph]] of the [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|extended graph]] below
- the context of a node in an induced graph are its parents (assume all all edges are pointing down)
  - context of F = AEF
  - context of D = BED
  - context of E = ABE
  - context of C = ABC
  - context of B = AB
  - context of A = A
- merge all nodes in the [[AND／OR Search Trees (AOT)|AND/OR Search Tree]] that have the same context
