<strong>Constrained Minimum Spanning Tree (CMST)</strong> is an MST that satisfies 1 or more constraints

# Example Constraints

- Any subtree rooted at a neighbor of the main root can have at most ν nodes. That is if a node A is directly connected to the main root in the tree, then the subtree (cluster) rooted at A can have altogether at most ν nodes (including A itself).
  Motivation: each outgoing link from the root carries data to the group of nodes in the subtree. The larger is such a cluster, the larger is the expected data rate. The speed of the link and of the corresponding output port of the root node may limit this.

# Algorithms in Computing CMST

Let us outline 3 heuristic algorithms for that last example constraint
