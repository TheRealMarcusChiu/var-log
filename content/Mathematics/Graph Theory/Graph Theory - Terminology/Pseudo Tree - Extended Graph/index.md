- <strong>Pseudo Tree</strong> - a <strong>pseudo tree</strong> of an undirected graph 𝐆 = (𝐕, 𝐄) is a directed rooted tree 𝐓 = (𝐕, 𝐄') if any arc in 𝐄 which is not in 𝐄' is a back-arc in 𝐓 (i.e. it connects a node in 𝐓 to an ancestor in 𝐓). The arcs in 𝐄' do not have to be in 𝐄
- <strong>Extended Graph</strong> - given a pseudo tree 𝐓 of 𝐆, the extended graph of 𝐆 relative to 𝐓 includes also the arcs in 𝐄' that are not in 𝐄. That is, the <strong>extended graph</strong> is defined as 𝐆<sup>𝐓</sup> = (𝐕, 𝐄 ∪ 𝐄')

maximum height pseudo tree is simply a chain, finding the minimum height pseudo tree however is [[P - NP - NPC - NPI - NPO - NPH|NP-Complete]]. This problem is found in various tasks (e.g. finding the smallest possible [[Pseudo Tree - Extended Graph|AND/OR Search Graph]])
