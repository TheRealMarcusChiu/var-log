a <strong>cluster graph</strong> of a [[Graphical Models|graphical model]] ⟨<strong>𝐗</strong>, <strong>𝐃</strong>, 𝐒, <strong>𝐅</strong>, <strong>𝐂</strong>⟩ is an [[Graph Theory - Terminology|undirected graph]] where:

- each 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 is a subset of <strong>𝐗</strong>
- each edge (𝑖,𝑗) connecting 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒<sub>𝑖</sub> and 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒<sub>𝑗</sub>, is associated with a 𝑠𝑒𝑝𝑠𝑒𝑡 ⊆ {𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒<sub>𝑖</sub>  ∩ 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒<sub>𝑗</sub>}
- each factor 𝐹<sub>𝑖</sub> in <strong>𝐅</strong> is assigned to some 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒 𝑗 such that: 𝑆<sub>𝑖</sub> ⊆ 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒<sub>𝑗</sub>
- existence property & uniqueness property:
  - for each pair of 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑠 𝑖 & 𝑗:
    - for each variable 𝑋 ∊ {𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒<sub>𝑖</sub>  ∩ 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒<sub>𝑗</sub>}
      - there EXITS a UNIQUE path between 𝑖 & 𝑗 for which all 𝑐𝑙𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟-𝑛𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑠 and 𝑠𝑒𝑝𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 contain 𝑋

### Cluster Graph - Variants

- [[Cluster／Clique／Join／Junction Trees - Tree Decompositions - Tree-Width|Cluster Tree]] - a cluster graph has no cycles
- [[Mini-Cluster Graphs／Trees|Mini-Cluster Graphs/Trees]] - relaxes the existence-property and uniqueness-property
