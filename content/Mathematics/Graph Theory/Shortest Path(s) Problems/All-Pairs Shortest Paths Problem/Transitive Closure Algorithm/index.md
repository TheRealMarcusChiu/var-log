<strong>Transitive Closure Algorithm</strong> solves the [[All-Pairs Shortest Paths Problem]]

input:

- G(V,E)
- NxN boolean matrix A where aᵢⱼ=1 <=> (i,j)∈E

output:

- a matrix A, where A\[i,j]=1 if there exist a path i ~> j

# Algorithm Implementation

```
Algorithm(A,n) {
	for k = 1 to n:
		for i = 1 to n:
			for j = 1 to n:
				A[i,j] = A[i,j] or (A[i,k] and A[k,j])
	return matrix A
}
```
