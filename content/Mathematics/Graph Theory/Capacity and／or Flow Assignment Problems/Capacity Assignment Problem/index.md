<strong>Capacity Assignment Problem</strong> determine the optimal capacities of each link, when given assigned flow value of each link and traffic demand between each pair of nodes

# <strong>Problem</strong>

assuming that the following information is given as input:

- network topology
- traffic matrix R, where each entry R<sub>pq</sub> is the traffic demand from node p to q
- flow routing, in the form of a prescribed flow value f<sub>i</sub> on each link i. These values are collected in the flow vector f = (f<sub>1</sub>,<sub></sub>f<sub>2</sub>, ..., f<sub>l</sub>)
- an upper limit T<em><sub>max</sub></em> on the network-wide mean delay
- a cost function d<sub>i</sub>(C<sub>i</sub>) for each link. this means, if we allocate C<sub>i</sub> capacity to link i, then its cost will be d<sub>i</sub>(C<sub>i</sub>). A special case when the problem is well solvable is the linear cost with fixed charge. In thus case the cost function is of the form: 

  where d<sub>i</sub> and d<sub>i0</sub> are constants

### Objective

Find the link capacities C = (C<sub>1</sub>, C<sub>2</sub>, . . . , C<sub>l</sub>), such that the total cost:

is minimized

### Constraints

- <strong>the flow cannot exceed the capacity on any link:</strong>
  f<sub>i</sub> ≤ C<sub>i</sub>(∀i)
  in vector form:
  f ≤ C
- <strong>the capacity is non-negative:</strong>
  C<sub>i</sub>≥ 0 (∀i)
  in vector form:
  C ≥ 0
- <strong>the network-wide mean delay cannot exceed T<sub>max</sub>:</strong>
  using the formula we derived for T (refer to: [[Network Wide Mean Delay]]) this can be expressed as

  where γ is a constant that represents the total traffic rate within the network
  γ = Σ<sub>p,q</sub>\[R<sub>pq</sub>]

# <strong>Solution</strong>

if cost function d<sub>i</sub>(C<sub>i</sub>) is linear (i.e. d<sub>i</sub>(C<sub>i</sub>) = d<sub>i</sub>C<sub>i</sub> + d<sub>i0</sub>) there is an explicit formula for calculating the optimal capacity assignment:

![[Mathematics/Graph Theory/Capacity and／or Flow Assignment Problems/Capacity Assignment Problem/optimal-capacity-assignment-when-cost-function-is-linear.png|301]]

once optimal capacity values are known, we substitute them into the cost function to obtain the optimal total cost

after substituting the expression of C<sub>i,opt</sub> and rearranging we get
