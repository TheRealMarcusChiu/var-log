consider network design problems in which the link capacities are also to be dimensioned and the flows of traffic are to be routed

### Variants of The Problem

```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      {
        "content": "Variants",
        "header": true,

      },
      {
        "content": "Description",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      }
    ],
    [
      "<strong>[[Capacity Assignment Problem|capacity assignment problem]]</strong>",
      "<strong>given:</strong>\n- assigned flow value of each link\n- traffic demand between each pair of nodes\n\n<strong>objective:</strong>\n- determine the optimal capacities of each link"

### Heuristic Algorithms For Capacity and/or Flow Assignment

- branch exchange algorithm
- cut saturation algorithm
- routing with economies of scale
