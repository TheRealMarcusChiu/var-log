given:

- a graph which represents a flow network where every edge has a capacity
- two vertices source ‘s’ and sink ‘t’ in the graph

find the <strong>maximum flow</strong> from s to t with following constraints:

1. flow on an edge doesn’t exceed the given capacity of the edge
2. incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow for every vertex except s and t
