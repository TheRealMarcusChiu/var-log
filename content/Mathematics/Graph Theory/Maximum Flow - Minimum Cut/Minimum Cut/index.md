### Ways Finding Minimum Cut of a Graph

the minimum cut between 2 specified nodes can be obtained as a by-product of the [[Maximum／Max Flow|maximum flow]] computation. If however, we want an overall minimum cut of the whole graph, then a single maximum flow computation does not suffice

One can find the overall minimum cut directly, without using anything about maximum flows. Below we present 2 algorithms for this problem
- [[Minimum Cut - Contraction Algorithm]]
- [[Minimum Cut - Nagamochi-Ibaraki Algorithm]]
