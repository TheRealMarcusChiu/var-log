> To use GLUT and OpenGL from within Xcode:
>
> - Open Xcode located in "/Developer/Applications/"
> - Choose "New Project" from the file menu
> - Choose "Command Line Tool" under the Application template for Mac OS X
> - Choose type "C++"
> - Enter your desired project name and directory and click create
> - In the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" area click the "+" button, and select "OpenGL.framework"
> - Repeat for "GLUT.framework"
>
> When <code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">#including</font></code> OpenGL & GLUT header files (but not the regular ones like iostream) within Xcode, make sure to do so like this:
>
> ```
> #include <OpenGL/gl.h>
> #include <OpenGl/glu.h>
> #include <GLUT/glut.h>
> ```
>
> in other words:
>
> ```
> #include <name_of_framework/name_of_header_file.h>
> ```
