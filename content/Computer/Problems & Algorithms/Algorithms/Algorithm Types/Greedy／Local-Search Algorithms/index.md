a <strong>Greedy/Local-Search Algorithm</strong> is any [[Algorithms|algorithm]] that follows the problem-solving heuristic of making the locally optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum

# Principles of Greedy Strategy

- cast problem such that greedy choice + 1 sub-problem to solve
- show there is an optimal solution that includes greedy choice
- show optimal sub-structure: <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>optimal solution to sub-problem + greedy choice => optimal solution to original problem</code></span>

# Problems Using Greedy Algorithms

- activity selection problem
- Huffman code
