      "This kernel type uses the minimum set-up required for scheduling, memory management, and inter-process communication. This vastly reduces the amount of memory required for kernel use. The minimum size of the kernel means that the amount of extra communication required by device drivers reduces the maximum data flow through the kernel but also decreases kernel response time to interrupts. Microkernels are typically found in real-time systems"

What you normally get is a stripped-down monolithic kernel that has the majority of device drivers removed but still all of the system services within the kernel space. The device drivers will be attached to the kernel as required when starting up or running. These kernels are typically found on desktops, your Windows, Mac, and Linux OS flavors"

The programmer using this kernel is responsible for correctly accessing the device they wish to use. I do not know of an instance of the kernel type where it is used outside of academia but I’m happy to be corrected"
