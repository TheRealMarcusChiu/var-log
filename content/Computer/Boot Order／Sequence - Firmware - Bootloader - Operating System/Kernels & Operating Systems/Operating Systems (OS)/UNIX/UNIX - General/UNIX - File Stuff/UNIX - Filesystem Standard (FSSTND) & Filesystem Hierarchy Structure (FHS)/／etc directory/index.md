<strong>/etc directory</strong> contains host-specific system-wide [configuration files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_file)

### Origin of Name

There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In early versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell labs, <code>/etc</code> is referred to as the <em>etcetera directory</em>, as this directory historically held everything that did not belong elsewhere (however, the FHS restricts <code>/etc</code> to static configuration files and may not contain binaries). Since the publication of early documentation, the directory name has been re-explained in various ways. Recent interpretations include backronyms such as "Editable Text Configuration" or "Extended Tool Chest".
