###### /var directory

- variable files
- contains files to which the system writes data during the course of its operation
- files whose content is expected to continually change during normal operation of the system—such as logs, spool files, and temporary e-mail files
- is specific for each system, i.e., not shared over the network with other computers

### Subdirectories
