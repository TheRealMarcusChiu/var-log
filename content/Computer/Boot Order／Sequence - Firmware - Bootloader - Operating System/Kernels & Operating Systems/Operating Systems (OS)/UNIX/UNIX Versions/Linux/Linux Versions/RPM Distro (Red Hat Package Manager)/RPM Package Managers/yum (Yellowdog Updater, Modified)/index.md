###### yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified)

```excerpt
- is an automatic updater and package installer/remover for rpm systems
- it automatically computes dependencies and figures out what things should occur to install packages
- it makes it easier to maintain groups of machines without having to manually update each one using rpm. Yum has a plugin interface for adding simple features
- can also be used from other python programs via its module interface
```

# Configuration

> When changing the yum.repos.d
>
> ```

> ```

# Command

> [!expand]- basic commands
> Cheat sheet: <https://access.redhat.com/sites/default/files/attachments/rh_yum_cheatsheet_1214_jcs_print-1.pdf>
>
> Yum upgrade and yum update will perform update to the latest version of package, but:
>
> ```
> sudo yum update   # will preserve obsolete packages
> sudo yum upgrade  # will delete obsolete packages
> ```

> [!expand]- group
> The <code>yum groupinstall …</code> command installs a bundle of packages that are designated as a group so that you don't need to install a bunch of individual packages yourself to have all of the features. So <code>yum groupinstall "Engineering and Scientific”</code> would install a bunch of packages that someone decided should be used on engineering and scientific workstations.
>
> ## Install a bunch of packages deemed “Engineering and Scientific”:
>
> ````
> ```
> yum groupinstall "Engineering and Scientific"
> ```
> ````
>
> ## Would upgrade those packages if necessary (and install any new ones)
>
> ````
> ```
> yum groupupdate "Engineering and Scientific"
> ```
> ````
>
> ## Would remove all of them
>
> ````
> ```
> yum groupremove "Engineering and Scientific"
> ```
> ````
>
> ## will list the possible groups
>
> ````
> ```
> yum grouplist
> ```
> ````
>
> ## will show what packages are members of groupname (you will need "quotes" if there are spaces in the group name)
>
> ````

> yum groupinfo groupname
