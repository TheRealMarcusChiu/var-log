Specialized software to monitor system activity to detect suspicious behavior

- primary purpose is to detect intrusions, log suspicious events, and send alerts
- can detect both external and internal intrusions

2 approaches, often used in combination:

- <strong>anomaly detection</strong> - defines normal/expected behavior
  - threshold detection
  - profile based
- <strong>signature detection</strong> - defines proper use and attack patterns to look for detection

### Audit Records

A fundamental tool for intrusion detection

2 variants:

- native audit records - provided by O/S
  - always available but may not be optimum
- detection-specific audit records - IDS specific
  - Additional overhead but specific to IDS task
  - Often log individual elementary actions
  - e.g. may contain fields for: subject, action, object, exception-condition, resource-usage, time-stamp

### Anomaly Detection

Threshold detection

- checks excessive event occurrences over time
- alone a crude and ineffective intruder detector
- must determine both thresholds and time intervals

Profile based

- characterize past behavior of users / groups
- then detect significant deviations
- based on analysis of audit records
  - gather metrics: counter, gauge, interval timer, resource utilization
  - analyze: mean and standard deviation, multivariate, Markov process, time series, operational model

### Signature Detection

Observe events on system and apply a set of rules to
decide if intruder

Approaches:

- rule-based anomaly detection
  - analyze historical audit records for expected behavior, then match with current behavior
- rule-based penetration identification
  - rules identify known penetrations/weaknesses
  - often by analyzing attack scripts from Internet
  - supplemented with rules from security experts
