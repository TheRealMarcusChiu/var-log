###### Design Pattern

- is a general solution to a common problem
- is more than just an implementation design, but also communicates intent and the problem being addressed

It's the highest level of abstraction of a system. What kind of data storage is present, how do modules interact with each other, what recovery systems are in place? Just like design patterns, there are architectural patterns: MVC, 3-tier layered design, etc\n- Architecture is the bigger picture: the choice of frameworks, languages, scope, goals, and high-level methodologies (Rational, waterfall, agile, etc.)",
>       "- the design describes the implementation of each part of the system\n- Software design is about designing the individual modules/components. What are the responsibilities, functions, of module x? Of class Y? What can it do, and what not? What design patterns can be used?\n- Design is the smaller picture: the plan for how the code will be organized; how the contracts between different parts of the system will look; the ongoing <em>implementation</em> of the project's methodologies and goals. Specifications are written during this stage"
