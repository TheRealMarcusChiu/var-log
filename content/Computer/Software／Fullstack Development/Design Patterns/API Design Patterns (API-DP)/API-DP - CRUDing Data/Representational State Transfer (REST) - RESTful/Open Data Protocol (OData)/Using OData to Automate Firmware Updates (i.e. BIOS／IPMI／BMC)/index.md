[[Open Data Protocol (OData)]] firmware refers to using the standard OData protocol (over HTTP) to manage and update device firmware, especially in servers (like [[Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI)|IPMI]]/BMC) or IoT, allowing for RESTful updates (uploading, checking status) of [[Basic Input／Output System (BIOS)|BIOS]], [[Baseboard Management Controller (BMC)|BMC]], or other components via defined URLs, simplifying management by treating firmware like any other data resource, common in systems like NVIDIA DGX or some servers. It's a way to automate firmware updates over networks, distinct from general Over-the-Air (OTA) updates but using similar principles for remote management
