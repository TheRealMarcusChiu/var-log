# Microservices Architecture vs Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)

<strong>Microservices Architecture</strong> is a [[Architectural／Architecture Design Patterns (ADP)|software/architectural development technique]] —a variant of the <strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong> structural style— that arranges an application as a collection of loosely coupled services

- <strong>Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)</strong> has an enterprise scope
- <strong>Microservices Architecture</strong> has an application scope

# Service Types

- <strong>Stateful Service</strong> - a service that has a concept of a session or persistence, like a chat service.
- <strong>Stateless Service</strong> - a service that does <em>not</em> have a concept of a session, but rather performs individual self-contained tasks, like a video transcoding service
