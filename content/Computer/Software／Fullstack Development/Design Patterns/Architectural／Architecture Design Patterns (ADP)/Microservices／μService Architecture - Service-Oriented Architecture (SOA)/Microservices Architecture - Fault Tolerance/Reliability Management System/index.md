###### Reliability Management System
````excerpt
- one issue with [[Load Shedding／Shedder|load shedding]], [[Circuit-Breaker／Breaking|circuit breaking]] and [[Auto-Scaling／Scaler|auto-scaling]] is that these tools only have a localized view of the system
- factors they can consider include their own resource utilization, direct dependencies and number of incoming requests
- however, they can’t take a globalized view of the system and make decisions based on that
