> <span style="white-space: pre-wrap"><code>CREATE TABLE test (</code><br><code>  nonempty VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE CONSTRAINT non\_empty CHECK(length(nonempty)\>0)</code><br><code>)</code></span>
>
> - design schema first for all APIs and Events, Data Schema
> 	- use both OpenAPI/Swagger and gRPC
> 	- consume events (not API) by default)
> 	- data
> 		- change database to UTF-8
> 		- consistent CHECKS, metadata
> 		- enable a global feature like 'hash\_code' to minimize writes
> - invest in automation
> 	- deployment, code generation, dependency management
> - enable teams to write amazing and simple tests
> 	- drives quality, streamlines maintenance, enables continuous delivery
