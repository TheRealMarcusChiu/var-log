###### Keepalived

```excerpt
- provides frameworks for both load balancing and high availability
	- the load balancing framework relies on the well-known and widely used [[Linux Virtual Server (LVS)|LVS]]/[[IP Virtual Server (IPVS)|IPVS]] kernel module, which provides Layer 4 load balancing. Implements a set of health checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain and manage load balanced server pools according to their health.
	- the high availability framework is achieved by the [[Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP)]]. VRRP is a fundamental brick for router failover. In addition, keepalived implements a set of hooks to the VRRP finite state machine providing low-level and high-speed protocol interactions
- each Keepalived framework can be used independently or together to provide resilient infrastructures
- in this context, load balancer may also be referred to as a director or an LVS router
- in short, Keepalived provides two main functions:
	- health checking for LVS systems
	- implementation of the VRRPv2 stack to handle load balancer failover
