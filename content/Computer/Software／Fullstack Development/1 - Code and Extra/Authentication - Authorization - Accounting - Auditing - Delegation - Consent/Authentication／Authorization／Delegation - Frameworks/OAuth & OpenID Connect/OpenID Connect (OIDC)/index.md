###### OpenID Connect (OIDC)

```excerpt
- is an extension of [[Open Authorization (OAuth)]] adding delegated authentication (i.e. allowing Client application(s) to obtain a Resource Owner's information)
- is not backward compatible with OpenID 2 (or 1 for that matter). OpenID Connect is effectively version 3 of the OpenID specification
