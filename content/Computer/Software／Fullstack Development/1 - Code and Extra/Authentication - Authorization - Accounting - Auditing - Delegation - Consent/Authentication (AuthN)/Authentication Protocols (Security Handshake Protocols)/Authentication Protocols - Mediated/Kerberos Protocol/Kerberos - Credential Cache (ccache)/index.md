###### Credential Cache (ccache)

- holds Kerberos credentials while they remain valid and, generally, while the user’s session lasts, so that authenticating to a service multiple times (e.g., connecting to a web or mail server more than once) doesn’t require contacting the [[Key Distribution Center (KDC)|KDC]] every time.

# ccache - Basics

A ccache usually contains one initial ticket which is obtained usually by a password. If this ticket is a ticket-granting ticket, it can be used to obtain service tickets without the password. Because the credential cache does not store the password, less long-term damage can be done to the user’s account if the machine is compromised.

A ccache stores a default client principal name, set when the cache is created. This is the name shown at the top of the <code>[klist](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/user/user_commands/klist.html#klist-1) -A</code> output.

# ccache - Entries

Each normal cache entry includes:

- a service principal name
- a client principal name (which, in some ccache types, need not be the same as the default)
- lifetime information
- flags
- along with the credential itself

There are also other entries, indicated by special names, that store additional information.

# ccache - Types

The credential cache interface, like the [<em>keytab</em>](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/keytab_def.html#keytab-definition) and [<em>replay cache</em>](https://web.mit.edu/kerberos/krb5-1.12/doc/basic/rcache_def.html#rcache-definition) interfaces, uses <em><code><font style="color: rgb(122,134,154);">TYPE:value</font></code></em> strings to indicate the type of credential cache and any associated cache naming data to use.

There are several kinds of credentials cache supported in the MIT Kerberos library. Not all are supported on every platform. In most cases, it should be correct to use the default type built into the library.
