### Kafka Cluster - Architecture

- record/message/log
  - schema: {key, value, timestamp}
  - are immutable
  - configurable retention period
- broker is a node in a cluster that contain partition(s)
- producer writes records to a broker
- consumer reads records from a broker (pull instead of push)
- topic - logical name with 1 or more partitions
- partitions are replicated (normally 3x)
- ordering is guaranteed within a partition (not by topic)

###### Message Offset

- unique sequential id per partition
- each consumer keeps track of offset for each assigned partition
- this allows:
  - replays
  - consumers of different speeds

###### Message Delivery Guarantees

producer

- async (no guarantee)
- committed to leader
- committed to leader & quorum

consumer

- at-least-once (default) -
- at-most-once -
- effectively-once - at-least-once delivery
- exactly-once (maybe) -

### Kafka Cluster - 5 Core APIs

- [Producer API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerapi) allows an application to publish a stream of records to one or more Kafka topics
- [Consumer API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#consumerapi) allows an application to subscribe to one or more topics and process the stream of records produced to them
- [Streams API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/streams) allows an application to act as a <em>stream processor</em>, consuming an input stream from one or more topics and producing an output stream to one or more output topics, effectively transforming the input streams to output streams
- [Connector API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#connect) allows building and running reusable producers or consumers that connect Kafka topics to existing applications or data systems. For example, a connector to a relational database might capture every change to a table
- [Admin API](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#adminapi) allows managing and inspecting topics, brokers and other Kafka objects
