###### Command-Query Separation (CQS) Principle

```excerpt
- is [[Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) Principle|Command-Query Responsibility Segregation]] on a smaller scale
- is a principle of [[Imperative Programming Paradigm|imperative computer programming]]
- it states that every method should either be a:
	- <strong>command</strong> - change data
	- <strong>query</strong> - returns data
```

^excerpt

# CQS - Example

```
class OrderService {
	List<Order> createNewOrderAndFindOrdersBeforeTimestamp(Order newOrder, Timestamp timestamp);
}
```

Applying CQS on the OrderService would result in two methods as shown below

```
class OrderService {
	void createNewOrder(Order newOrder);
	List<Order> findOrdersBeforeTimestamp(Timestamp timestamp);
}
```
