Here are some key differences between <strong>[[Docker Compose]]</strong> and <strong>[[Docker Swarm]]</strong>:

1. <strong>Deployment</strong>: Docker Compose is designed for single-host deployments, whereas Docker Swarm is designed for multi-host deployments.
2. <strong>Scalability</strong>: Docker Compose does not provide native scaling capabilities, whereas Docker Swarm can scale services up or down to meet demand.
3. <strong>Load balancing</strong>: Docker Compose does not provide load balancing out of the box, whereas Docker Swarm includes built-in load balancing.
4. <strong>High availability</strong>: Docker Compose does not provide built-in high availability features, whereas Docker Swarm provides automatic failover and redundancy.

Overall, if you need to manage a complex deployment of containers across multiple nodes, Docker Swarm is the better choice. If you're developing or testing an application locally and need to spin up multiple containers quickly and easily, Docker Compose is the better choice
