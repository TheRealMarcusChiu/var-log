###### kubelet

```excerpt
- an agent that runs on each [[Kubernetes Worker Node Component|node]] in the cluster
- it makes sure that containers are running in a Pod
- the kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy
- the kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes
```
