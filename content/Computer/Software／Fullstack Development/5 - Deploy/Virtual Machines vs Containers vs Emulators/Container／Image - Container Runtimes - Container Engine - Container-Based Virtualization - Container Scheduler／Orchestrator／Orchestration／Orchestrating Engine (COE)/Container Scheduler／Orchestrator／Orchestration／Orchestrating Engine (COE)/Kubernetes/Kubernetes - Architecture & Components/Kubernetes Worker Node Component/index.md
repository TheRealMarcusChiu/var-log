###### Kubernetes Worker Node Component

```excerpt
- Run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment:
	- <strong>[[kubelet]]</strong> - ensures that Pods are running, including their containers
	- <strong>[[kube-proxy]]</strong> (optional) - maintains network rules on nodes to implement [Services](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
	- <strong>[[Kubernetes Container Network Interface (CNI)]]</strong> (e.g. [[Kube-router|kube-router]]) - a turn-key Kubernetes networking solution purpose built for operational simplicity and performance.
	- <strong>[[Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI)]]</strong> (e.g. [[Containerd|containerd]]) - software responsible for running [[Container／Image - Container Runtimes - Container Engine - Container-Based Virtualization - Container Scheduler／Orchestrator／Orchestration／Orchestrating Engine (COE)|containers]]
