### Important Terms

- <strong>bandwidth</strong> - width of a frequency band
- <strong>data rate</strong> - number of bits per second
- <strong>attenuate</strong> - the weakening of signals with distance from origin
- <strong>spread spectrum</strong> - spread the signal over a wider frequency band to minimize the impact of interference from other devices
  - <strong>frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)</strong> - is a <em>spread spectrum</em> technique that involves transmitting at different frequencies over time
  - <strong>direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS)</strong> - adds redundancy for greater tolerance of interference
- <strong>endpoint classes</strong>
  - base station
  - mobile - often relies on <em>base station</em> mediator for communication

## <strong>5 problems in Connecting Nodes</strong>

- [[network encoding]] - bits onto transmission medium
- [[network framing|framing]] - portray sequence of bits into a complete message
- [[network - error detection and correction|error detecting and correcting]] - detecting errors in data and possibly correct it
- [[network - reliable delivery|reliable delivery]] - making sure data was received
- [[Carrier Sense Multiple Access]] - sharing a single link
