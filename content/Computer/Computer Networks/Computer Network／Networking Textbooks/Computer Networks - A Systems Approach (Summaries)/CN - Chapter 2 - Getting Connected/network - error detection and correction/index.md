# Error Detection

design error detection algorithms that both:

- maximize probability of detecting errors
- use small number of redundant bits

techniques in detecting errors:

- <strong>Send Extra Copy</strong>

>
> - this is the extreme way
> - for each n-bits sent, send n redundant bits

- <strong>One-Dimensional Parity</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
>
> - involves adding one extra bit to a 7-bit block to balance the number of 1s
> - below is an even parity check
>   - 1 is added to the block if it contains odd number of 1’s, and
>   - 0 is added if it contains even number of 1’s

- <strong>Two-Dimensional Parity</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
>
> - two-dimensional parity does a <em>one-dimensional parity</em> calculation for each bit position across each of the bytes contained in the frame
>
> - this results a parity byte

- <strong>Checksum Algorithm</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
>
> - checksum idea: add up all the words transmitted and then transmit the result of the sum

- <strong>Internet Checksum Algorithm</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
>
> - internet checksum idea:
>   - data is separated into a sequence of 16-bit integers
>   - the 16-bit integers are added together using 16-bit ones complement arithmetic
>   - then take the ones complement of result
>   - that 16-bit number is the checksum
>
> - not as good at detecting errors than CRC, but is used because it is easier to implement than CRC

- <strong>Cyclic Redundancy Check</strong>

> [!expand]- Click here to expand...
>
> - steps:
>   - sender and receiver agrees upon a <em>divisor</em> polynomial C(x) of degree k
>   - T(x) = original message M(x) multiplied by xᵏ; that is, add <em>k</em> zeros at end of message
>   - divide T(x) by C(x) and find remainder
>   - subtract remainder from T(x)

# Error Correction

- requires more redundancy bits than error detecting
