###### Virtual Private Network (VPN)
````excerpt
- is a technology that creates a secure, [[Encryption|encrypted]] connection (“tunnel”) over an untrusted network like the internet
- is NOT a single protocol, thus under the OSI model it can operate at the:
	- [[2 - Data Link Layer|Data Link layer]] (e.g., [[L2TP／IPSec|L2TP/IPsec]])
	- [[3 - Network Layer|Network layer]] (e.g., [[WireGuard]], [[OpenVPN]] in TUN mode)
	- [[4 - Transport Layer|Transport]]/[[5 - Session Layer|Session layers]] (e.g., [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) - Transport Layer Security (TLS)|SSL/TLS]]-based VPNs)
