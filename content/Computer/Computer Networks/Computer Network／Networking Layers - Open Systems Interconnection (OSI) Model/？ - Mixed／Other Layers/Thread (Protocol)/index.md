###### Thread (Protocol)

```excerpt
- doesn't fit into a single layer; it is a protocol stack that occupies the bottom layers of the OSI model (i.e. layers 1 to 4)
- it is designed to be "[[7 - Application Layer|application-layer]] agnostic," meaning it doesn't define what the application does (like controlling a light or a thermostat), but rather how the data gets from point A to point B
```
