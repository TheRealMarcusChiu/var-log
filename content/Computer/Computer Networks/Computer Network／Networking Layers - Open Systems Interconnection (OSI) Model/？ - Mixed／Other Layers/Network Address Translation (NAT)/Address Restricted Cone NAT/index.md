<strong>Address Restricted Cone NAT</strong>

- a type of [[Network Address Translation (NAT)|Dynamic NAT]]
- works in the same way as a [[Full Cone NAT - Port Forwarding|Full Cone NAT]] but applies additional restrictions based on the source IP address
- the internal client must first have sent packets to IP address X before it can receive packets originating from IP address X
- in terms of restrictions, the only requirement is that packets come in on the mapped port and from an IP address that the internal client has sent packets to
