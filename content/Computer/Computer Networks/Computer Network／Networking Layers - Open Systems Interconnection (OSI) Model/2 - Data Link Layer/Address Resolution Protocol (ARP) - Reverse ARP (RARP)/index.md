# Terms Simple
- <strong>ARP </strong>- find [[Ethernet - Media Access Control (MAC) Address - Physical Hardware Address|MAC/Physical Hardware Address]] given [[IPv4 - Address|IP address]]
- <strong>RARP</strong> - find IP address given MAC address

# Terms Detailed
- <strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong> is a [[2 - Data Link Layer|data link layer]]/[[3 - Network Layer|network layer]] protocol used to convert an [[IPv4 - Address|IP address]] into a physical address (called a Data Link Control (DLC) address), such as an [[802.3 - Ethernet|Ethernet]]'s [[Ethernet - Media Access Control (MAC) Address - Physical Hardware Address|MAC address]]. A host wishing to obtain a MAC address broadcasts an ARP request onto the TCP/IP network. The host on the network that has the IP address in the request then replies with its MAC address
- <strong>Reverse ARP (RARP)</strong> is used by a host to discover its IP address. In this case, the host broadcasts its MAC address and a RARP server replies with the host's IP address
