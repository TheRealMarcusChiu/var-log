###### InfiniBand (IB)

```excerpt
- is a computer networking communications standard used in high-performance computing that features very high throughput and very low latency
- is both a [[1 - Physical Layer|Layer 1]] & [[2 - Data Link Layer|Layer 2]] protocol

Personal opinion: CX-4 is such an ugly connector. Who designed that? Topspin switches are cheap and cool for learning Infiniband, and most of them operate on this standard."

      "Switches that operate to this standard usually provide connections rated at a throughput of 40Gbps (32Gbps after encoding loss) and a latency significantly lower than Ethernet's. The connection type for most 40Gb Infiniband is (QSFP+). A lot of newer Mellanox switches offer something they call VPI, which allows configuration on a port by port basis as to which protocol you'd like to use (Ethernet or Infiniband). I personally like this feature, because it allows for flexibility within my lab.\n\nBefore they were bought out by 100 different companies, there was a company called Voltaire that made QDR switches. If you're looking for the cheapest QDR switch you can find, that's probably a route worth exploring."
