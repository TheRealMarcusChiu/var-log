###### Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)
- is an extension of the [[Hypertext／Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - 1／1.1／2|HTTP]] that uses [[Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) - Transport Layer Security (TLS)|SSL/TLS]] to secure its contents before passing the data to the [[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)|TCP]]

# Enabling HTTPS

to enable HTTPS you will need to apply for a [[Digital SSL／TLS Certificate|SSL/TLS digital certificate]]
- see [[Digital SSL／TLS Certificate - Creation Processes (Enabling HTTPS)|Digital SSL/TLS Certificate - Creation Processes (Enabling HTTPS)]]
