# Eureka + Ribbon

```
App ---> Ribbon (client library) ---> multiple service instances
         ^                   |
         |                   v
    Eureka (registry) <------+
```

- load balancing happens <strong>inside the application process</strong>
- apps must embed Ribbon & talk to Eureka

# Envoy

```
App ---> Envoy proxy -----> Service instances (sidecar)
```

- load balancing, discovery, retries, metrics, etc. done <strong>in the proxy</strong>
- app code stays clean and unaware of network logic
- envoy usually deployed as a side-car to the app
