###### SSL (and its successor, TLS)
````excerpt
- is a [[Computer Network／Networking Communication Protocols|network protocol]] that operates directly on top of [[Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)|TCP]] at the [[5 - Session Layer|session layer]], although there are also implementations for datagram-based protocols such as [[Universal／User Datagram Protocol (UDP)|UDP]]. This way, protocols on higher layers (such as [[Hypertext／Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) - 1／1.1／2|HTTP]]) can be left unchanged while still providing a secure connection.
