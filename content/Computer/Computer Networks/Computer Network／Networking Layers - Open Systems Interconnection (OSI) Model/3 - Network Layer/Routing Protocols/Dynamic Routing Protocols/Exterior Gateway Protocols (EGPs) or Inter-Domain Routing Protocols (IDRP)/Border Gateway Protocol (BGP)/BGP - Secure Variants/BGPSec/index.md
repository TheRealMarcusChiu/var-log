<strong>BGPSec</strong>:

- provides route path validation
- [[Autonomous System (AS) - Domain|autonomous systems]] on the path sign outgoing BGP updates
- signatures covers:
  - netowkr-prefix
  - ASPATH
  - ASN of neighbor receiving this update
- BGP update also includes all signatures accumulated on the path

### BGPSec Example

![[Computer/Computer Networks/Computer Network／Networking Layers - Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model/3 - Network Layer/Routing Protocols/Dynamic Routing Protocols/Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs) or Inter-Domain Routing Protocols (IDRP)/Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)/BGP - Secure Variants/BGPSec/prefix-hijacking-example.png|500]]

BGP updates carry accumulated signatures

### BGPSec Benefits and Challenges

benefits:

- no path alteration/shortening attacks

challenges:

- Require online crypto to produce/verify signatures
- Transition to BGPSec
  - Full path verification requires all [[Autonomous System (AS) - Domain|Autonomous Systems]] on the path to sign the BGP update
  - Incentive challenge: Given an expensive BGPSec secured path vs a cheap non-secured path, which one to choose?
