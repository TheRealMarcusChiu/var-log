###### Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)

```excerpt
- is an implementation of the [[Link-State Protocols]] with extra features:
	- authentication of routing messages - prevents malicious attacks
	- additional hierarchy - allows scalability
	- load balancing - allows multiple routes to the same place at the same cost
```

^excerpt

# OSPF Message

- there are 5 types of OSPF message
- which all share the same header format (see Figure 3.34)
- a single OSPF message may contain multiple <em>LSAs</em>

<em>![[Computer/Computer Networks/Computer Network／Networking Layers - Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model/3 - Network Layer/Routing Protocols/Dynamic Routing Protocols/Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) or Intra-Domain Routing Protocols (IDRP)/Link-State Protocols/Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)/1.png|518x250]]</em>

# Link-State Advertisement (LSA)

- is the basic building block of link-state messages in OSPF
- there are multiple types of LSAs
  - <strong>Type 1 LSAs</strong> - advertise the cost of links between routers
  - <strong>Type 2 LSAs</strong> - advertise networks to which the advertising router is connected
  - <strong>other types</strong> - used to support additional hierarchy

# Type 1 LSA

<em>![[Computer/Computer Networks/Computer Network／Networking Layers - Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Model/3 - Network Layer/Routing Protocols/Dynamic Routing Protocols/Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) or Intra-Domain Routing Protocols (IDRP)/Link-State Protocols/Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)/2.png|449x250]]</em>

- <strong>LS Age</strong> -
- <strong>Link state ID</strong> and <strong>Advertising router</strong>
  - fields are identical in a <em>Type 1 LSA</em>
  - is a 32-bit identifier for the router that created this LSA (usually the lowest IP address of the router)
- <strong>LS sequence number</strong> - is used exactly as described above to detect old or duplicate LSAs
- <strong>Length</strong> - length in bytes of complete LSA
- TODO
