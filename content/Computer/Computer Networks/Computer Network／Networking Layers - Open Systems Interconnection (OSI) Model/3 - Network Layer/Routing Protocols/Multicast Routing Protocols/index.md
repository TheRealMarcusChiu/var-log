###### Multicast Routing Protocols

```excerpt
- manages group membership and controls the path that multicast data takes over the network
- updates a multicast routing table (as unicast routing protocols update unicast routing tables)
```

^excerpt

# Multicast Reverse Path Forwarding (mRPF or just RPF) aka Reverse Path Broadcast (RPB)

- often used in tandem with multicast protocols
- the underlying assumptions of RPF check are that:
  - the <em>unicast routing table</em> must be correct and converged (i.e. up to date)
  - the path used from a sender to a router and the reverse path from the router back to the sender are symmetric

# Multicasting Protocols Implementations

- [[Distance-Vector Multicast Routing Protocol (DVMRP)]]
- [[Protocol Independent Multicasting (PIM)]]
- [[Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP)]]
