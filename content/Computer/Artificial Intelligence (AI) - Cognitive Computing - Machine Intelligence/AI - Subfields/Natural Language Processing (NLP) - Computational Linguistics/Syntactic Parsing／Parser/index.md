<strong>Syntactic Parsing</strong> is a method of syntactic analysis of a sentence (e.g. the task of determining the parse-tree of a given sentence)

- <strong>[[Formal Grammar - Formal Language|grammar]]</strong> - a formal specification of the structures allowable in the language
- <strong>parser</strong> - algorithm for assigning syntactic structure to an input sentence

### Syntactic Parsing - Types

```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      {
        "content": "<strong>[[Constituency／Phrase Parsing|Constituency/Phrase Parsing]]</strong>",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- focuses on building out parse-tree of constituents (e.g. sub-phrases and words)"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "<strong>[[Dependency Parsing]]</strong>",
        "header": true,
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (e.g. marking words like subject, direct objects, etc)"
    ]
  ]
}
```
