### From [[Constituency／Phrase Parsing|Constituency/Phrase Parsing]] to [[Dependency Parsing]]

### 2 Subtasks

1. identifying all the head-dependent relations in the structure
   1. relies heavily on the use of head rules constituency parsing, first developed for use in [[Probabilistic Lexicalized CFG (PLCFG)|lexicalized probabilistic]] parsers (e.g. Collin's Parser)
   2. Here’s a simple and effective algorithm from Xia and Palmer (2001):
      1. Mark the head child of each node in a phrase structure, using the appropriate head rules
      2. In the dependency structure, make the head of each non-head child depend on the head of the head-child
2. identifying the correct dependency relations for these relations
