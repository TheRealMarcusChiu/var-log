# Internals of Claude Code LLM

LLMs can increase context window by:

- chunking
- indexing
- iterating

Claude builds a mental index (not a full snapshot) of the code base by:

- summarizing files
- extract symbols (functions, classes, APIs)
- keeps compressed representations instead of raw code
- e.g. "There is a \`UserService\` that validates auth tokens and calls \`BillingClient\`"

Claude rereads the code file when needed

Claude Code is like "<em>A very fast engineer who can only have 200k tokens open on their desk, but can walk back to the bookshelf unlimited times</em>"
