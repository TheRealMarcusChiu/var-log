# Core AI Agent Frameworks (General‑Purpose)

These frameworks are foundational for building intelligent agents that can interact with LLMs, external tools, and workflows.

```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      {
        "content": "LangChain",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- One of the most widely used frameworks for connecting LLMs with tools, memory, APIs, and workflows.\n- Huge ecosystem and integrations (vector DBs, external services).\n- Best as the <em>foundation layer</em> you build on. ([Index.dev](https://www.index.dev/blog/best-mcp-ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "LangGraph",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- Built on LangChain, uses <strong>graph/state‑machine workflows</strong> to manage complex, multi‑step agent logic.\n- Good for agents that need branching, retries, or structured execution paths.\n- Often paired with LangChain for robust workflow orchestration. ([DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "Semantic Kernel",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- SDK from Microsoft emphasizing <strong>skills</strong>, planners, memory, and cross‑platform support (Python, C\\#, Java).\n- Useful for enterprise‑grade solutions with integration needs.\n- Great if you’re in a Microsoft ecosystem. ([JPLoft](https://www.jploft.com/blog/best-ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "LlamaIndex",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- Not strictly a full agent <em>runtime</em>, but a powerful toolkit for <strong>data/RAG-centric agents</strong>: indexing, retrieval, and grounding agents in real content.\n- Excellent for knowledge‑intensive assistants.

# Autonomous & Multi‑Agent Orchestration Frameworks

These help coordinate multiple agents or automate tasks with little supervision.

```merge-table
{
  "rows": [
    [
      {
        "content": "[[AutoGen]] (Microsoft)",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- Strong support for <strong>multi‑agent orchestration</strong> and async communication.\n- Useful for projects requiring specialized agent roles (planner, coder, reviewer). ([DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "[[AutoGPT]]",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- One of the earliest autonomous agent frameworks. Automatically decomposes goals into subtasks.\n- Great for experimentation and understanding autonomous workflows.\n- Simpler and less structured — good for learning/prototyping.

    [
      {
        "content": "[[CrewAI]]",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- Focuses on <strong>role‑based agent “crews”</strong> that collaborate on tasks.\n- Easier to start with than some graph‑based frameworks. ([DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))"
    ],
    [
      {
        "content": "Phidata / Agno",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"
      },
      "- Clean Python APIs and built‑in features for launching multi‑agent systems.\n- Ideal if you want a fast prototype or a lightweight orchestration layer. ([DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/ai-agent-frameworks?utm_source=chatgpt.com))"

# Specialized & Emerging Frameworks

Great supplements to the above or good choices for specific niches.
