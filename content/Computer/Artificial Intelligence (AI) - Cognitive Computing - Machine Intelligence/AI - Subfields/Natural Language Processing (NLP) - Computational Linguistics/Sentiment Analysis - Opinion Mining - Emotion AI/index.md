- <strong>Sentiment</strong> (opinion) - a view or attitude towards a situation or event
- <strong>Sentiment Analysis</strong> (also known as <strong>Opinion Mining</strong> or <strong>E</strong><strong>motion AI</strong>)
	- refers to the use of [[Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Computational Linguistics|natural language processing]], [text analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_analytics), [computational linguistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_linguistics), and [biometrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biometrics) to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study [[Affective／Emotion Science|affective]] states and subjective information
	- is a kind of [[Text Classification]]
	- is the detection of attitudes given a body of Text:
		- Attitude Source/Holder
		- Attitude Target/Aspect/Attribute
		- Attitude Type - from either:
			- a set of types (e.g. like, love, hate, value, desire, etc)
			- weighted polarity (e.g. positive-neutral-negative, together with strength)

# <strong>Sentiment Analysis - Task Types</strong>

increasing complexity:
- is the attitude of text positive or negative
- rank the attitude of test from 1 to 5
- detect the target, source and/or attitude types
