###### Hatzivassiloglou and McKeown for Identifying Word Polarity

- intuition:
  - adjectives conjoined by "and" have same polarity (e.g. fair and legitimate, corrupt and brutal)
  - adjectives conjoined by "but" have different polarity (e.g. fair but brutal)
- processes:
  - start with seed set (i.e. a labelled set of sentiment words)
  - expand seed set to conjoined adjectives, which results in a graph
  - use clustering algorithm to divide the graph
