###### <strong>Part-of-Speech (PoS) Tagging</strong>

- task of reading a body text and assigning [[Part of Speech (PoS)|parts of speech]] to each word

### PoS Tagging - Methods

```merge-table

      },
      "- given input sentence we assign each word ALL POSSIBLE PoS tags, according to dictionary\n- then we use rules to REMOVE tags, until each word has exactly one PoS Tag\n- rules a hand built (not auto-learned)"

      "- given input sentence we assign each word a SINGLE PoS tag, according to dictionary\n- then we use rules to TRANSFORM tags, until no more transformations are made\n- rules can be auto-learned by feeding it training corpus"
