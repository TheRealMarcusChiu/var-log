- <strong>Information Retrieval (IR)</strong> retrieves relevant facts from unstructured data that are NOT specified in advance
- <strong>Information Extraction (IE)</strong> extracting relevant facts from unstructured data that are specified in advance

both <strong>IE</strong> and <strong>IR</strong> are subtasks of [[Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Computational Linguistics]]
# IR/IE - Other
an implementation of [[Feature Projection／Extraction - Embeddings|Feature Extraction]] that extracts specific [[Features - Feature Functions - Feature Engineering - Feature-Based Models|Features]] (i.e. entities, relations, events, etc) from text
