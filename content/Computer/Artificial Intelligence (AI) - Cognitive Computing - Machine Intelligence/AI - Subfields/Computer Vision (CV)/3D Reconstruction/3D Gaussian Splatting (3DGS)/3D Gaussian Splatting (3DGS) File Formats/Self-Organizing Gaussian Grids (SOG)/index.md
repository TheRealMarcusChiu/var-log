###### Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids

```excerpt
- is a technique for compressing [[3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)]] scenes
- it reorganizes thee high-dimensional attributes into locally smooth 2D grids, allowing standard image compression techniques to achieve high compression ratios
- it uses a Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS) algorithm to sort Gaussian splat properties, grouping similar attributes spatially to create structured 2D "attribute images" from the initial noisy data
```

# SOG - How to Create

Given a [[3DGS Polygon File Format (PLY)|PLY]] file convert to SOG

- <https://github.com/playcanvas/splat-transform> - newer but fails at [SegFault Bug](https://github.com/playcanvas/splat-transform/issues/49)
- <https://github.com/playcanvas/sogs> - deprecated but still works as of Sept 2025
