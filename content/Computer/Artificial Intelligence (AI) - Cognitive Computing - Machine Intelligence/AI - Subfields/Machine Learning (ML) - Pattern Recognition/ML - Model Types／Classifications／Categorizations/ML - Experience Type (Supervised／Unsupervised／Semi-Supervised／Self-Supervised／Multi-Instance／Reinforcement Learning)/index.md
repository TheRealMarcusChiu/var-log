# Experience - Solving 1 Experience Type With Another

- by [[Probability (Product Rule - Chain Rule)|chain-rule]], we can solve the unsupervised problem of modeling 𝐏(𝑋<sub>1</sub>, ..., 𝑋<sub>𝑛</sub>) by splitting it into 𝑛 supervised learning problems
- by [[Bayes' Rule／Theorem／Law (Prior - Posterior - Distribution - Likelihood - Probability of Evidence)|bayes-rule]], we can solve the supervised learning problem of learning 𝐏(𝑌|𝑋) by using unsupervised learning to learn the joint distribution 𝐏(𝑋,𝑌)
