###### Reinforcement Learning (RL)

```excerpt
- is the science of decision making
- is an area of [[Machine Learning (ML) - Pattern Recognition|machine learning]] concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment in order to maximize some notion of cumulative reward
- almost all RL problems can be formulated as a [[Markov Decision Process (MDP)]]
```

^excerpt

# RL - Learning Paradigms

- there is no supervisor, only a scalar reward signal
- feedback may not be instantaneous (i.e. delayed)
- time-series related (sequential, not [[Independent and Identically Distributed (IID)|i.i.d.]] data)
- agent's action affects the subsequent data it receives

# RL - Components

rewards

- a reward 𝑅<sub>𝑡</sub> is a scalar feedback signal
- indicates how well the agent is doing at timestep 𝑡
- the agent's job is to maximize cumulative reward

RL is based on the <strong>reward hypothesis</strong> - all goals can be described by the maximization of expected cumulative reward

sequential decision making

- the goal is to select actions to maximize total future reward
- actions may have long-term consequences
- the reward may not be instantaneous (i.e. delayed)
- it may be better to sacrifice immediate reward at the cost of long-term reward

at each time-step 𝑡 the agent:

- receives reward 𝑅<sub>𝑡</sub>
- receives observation 𝑂<sub>𝑡</sub>
- does an action 𝐴<sub>𝑡</sub>

![[Computer/Artificial Intelligence (AI) - Cognitive Computing - Machine Intelligence/AI - Subfields/Machine Learning (ML) - Pattern Recognition/ML - Models/Reinforcement Learning (RL)/reinforcement-learning-agent-and-environment.png|301]]

history

- is the sequence of rewards, observations, and actions from time-step 1 to 𝑡
- 𝐻<sub>1𝑡</sub> = \[𝑅<sub>1</sub>, 𝑂<sub>1</sub>, 𝐴<sub>1</sub>, 𝑅<sub>2</sub>, 𝑂<sub>2</sub>, 𝐴<sub>2</sub>, ..., 𝑅<sub>𝑡</sub>, 𝑂<sub>𝑡</sub>, 𝐴<sub>𝑡</sub>]

what happens next depends on the history

- agent selects actions
- the environment selects observations & rewards

state

- is the summary of history used to determine what happens next
- is a function of history:
  - 𝑆<sub>𝑡</sub> = 𝑓(𝐻<sub>1𝑡</sub>)

2 state types:

- environment state 𝑆<sub>𝑡</sub><sup>𝑒</sup>
  - is the environment's internal state representation
  - is whatever data the environment uses to pick the next observation & reward
  - has the Markov property
- agent state 𝑆<sub>𝑡</sub><sup>𝑎</sup>
  - is the agent's internal state representation
  - is whatever data the agent uses to pick the next action
  - is the information used by RL algorithms
  - it can be any function of history
    - 𝑆<sub>𝑡</sub><sup>𝑎</sup> = 𝑓(𝐻<sub>1𝑡</sub>)

state with [[Markov Condition／Assumption／Property - First／Second／Nth-Order - (Pairwise - Local - Global - Markov-Blanket) - Causal Markov (CMC) Condition／Assumption／Property|Markov property]]

- a state 𝑆<sub>𝑖</sub> has Markov property iff: 𝐏(𝑆<sub>𝑡+1</sub>|𝑆<sub>1</sub>, ..., 𝑆<sub>𝑡</sub>) = 𝐏(𝑆<sub>𝑡+1</sub>|𝑆<sub>𝑡</sub>)
- the entire history from time 1 to 𝑡 (i.e. 𝐻<sub>1𝑡</sub>) has the Markov property

information/markov state:

- has the Markov property
- contains all useful information from the history 𝐻<sub>1𝑡</sub>
- once the information state is known, the history is no longer needed
- is a [[Sufficient Statistic|sufficient statistic]] that can be used in determining the future

# RL Agent - Types

containing value function and/or policy function:

- <strong>value-based</strong> - an agent that stores the value function (policy is implicit, just readout the value function)
- <strong>policy-based</strong> - an agent that stores the policy (no value function)
- <strong>actor-critic</strong> - stores both the policy and reward

containing a model of the environment:

- <strong>model-free</strong> - policy and/or value function
- <strong>model-based</strong> - policy and/or value function
