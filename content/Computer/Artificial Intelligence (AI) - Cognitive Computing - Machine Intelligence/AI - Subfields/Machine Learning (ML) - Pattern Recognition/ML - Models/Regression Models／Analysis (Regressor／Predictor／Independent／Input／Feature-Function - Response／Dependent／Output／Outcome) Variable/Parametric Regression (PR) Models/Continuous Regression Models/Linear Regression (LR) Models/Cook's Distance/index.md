###### Cook's Distance

```excerpt
- is used to determine the influence of a data point and highlight particular points worth investigating for validity
- it can also be used to highlight regions of the 𝑋 space that need further investigating with more data
```

# Formula

The distance 𝐷<sub>𝑖</sub> for data point 𝑖 is defined as:

- $D_i = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^n (\hat{y}_j - \hat{y}_{j(i)})^2}{p \hat{𝜎}^2}$

where:

- 𝑦̂<sub>𝑗(𝑖)</sub> - is the fitted value for data point 𝑗 with the 𝑖<sup>th</sup> observation removed
