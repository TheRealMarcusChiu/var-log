###### Interactions Effects

- interaction effects occur when the effect of one regressor depends on the value of another regressor
- for example, the relationship between condiments and enjoyment probably depends on the food-type:
  - enjoyment = condiment + food-type
    <br>
- in simple models we assess the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable. This kind of an effect is called a main effect. However, it can be a mistake to assess only main effects
- in more complex study areas, the independent variables might interact with each other. Interaction effects indicate that a third variable influences the relationship between an independent and dependent variable

convert

- enjoyment = condiment + food-type

to

- enjoyment = 𝜃·condiment + 𝜃·food-type + 𝜃·condiment\*food-type

where:

- condiment\*food-type - is the interacting term

When you have statistically significant interaction effects, you can’t interpret the main effects without considering the interactions

### Interacting Effect Order

- 2-way interaction
- 3-way interaction
- N-way interaction
