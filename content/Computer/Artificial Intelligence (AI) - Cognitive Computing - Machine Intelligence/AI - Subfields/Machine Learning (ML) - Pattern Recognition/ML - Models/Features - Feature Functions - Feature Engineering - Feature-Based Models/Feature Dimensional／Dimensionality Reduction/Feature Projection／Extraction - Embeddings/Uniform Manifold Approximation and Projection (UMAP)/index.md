###### Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)

```excerpt
- is a [[Feature Dimensional／Dimensionality Reduction|dimension reduction technique]] similarly to [[T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE／tSNE)|t-SNE]]
- is also a general [[Non-Linear／Nonlinear Dimensionality Reduction (NLDR) - Manifold Learning|non-linear dimension reduction]]
- introduced in 2018
```

# UMAP - Assumptions

The algorithm is founded on three assumptions about the data:

1. the data is [[Uniform Distribution|uniformly distributed]] on [[Riemannian Manifolds - Riemannian Spaces|Riemannian manifold]]
2. the [[Riemannian Metric - Riemannian Metric Tensor|Riemannian metric]] is locally constant (or can be approximated as such)
3. the manifold is locally connected

From these assumptions it is possible to model the manifold with a fuzzy topological structure. The embedding is found by searching for a low dimensional projection of the data that has the closest possible equivalent fuzzy topological structure.
