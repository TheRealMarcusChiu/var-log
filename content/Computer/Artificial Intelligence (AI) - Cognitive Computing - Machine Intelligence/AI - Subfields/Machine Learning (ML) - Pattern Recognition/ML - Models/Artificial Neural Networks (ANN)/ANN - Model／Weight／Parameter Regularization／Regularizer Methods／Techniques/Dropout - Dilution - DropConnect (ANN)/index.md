###### Dropout - Dilution - DropConnect

```excerpt
- is a [[ML - Model／Weight／Parameter Regularization／Regularizer Methods／Techniques|regularization method]] for [[Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)|artificial neural networks]] that prevents [[Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)|t]]hem from [[Estimator & Predictor／Model (Bias - Variance - Irreducible／Bayes／Noise) Error - Predictor／Model Capacity／Complexity - Generalization (Underfit - Goodfit - Overfit)|overfitting]]
- the key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much.
- introduced by Hinton et al. in 2012

# Dropout Neural Network Model Description

Consider a neural network with 𝐿 hidden layers. Let:

- 𝑙∈{1, ..., 𝐿} index the hidden layers of the network
- 𝐳<sup>(𝑙)</sup> is the vector input into layer 𝑙
- 𝐲<sup>(𝑙)</sup> is the vector output from layer 𝑙 (𝐲<sup>(0)</sup> = 𝐱 is the input)
- 𝑊<sup>(𝑙)</sup> and 𝑏<sup>(𝑙)</sup> are the weights and biases at layer 𝑙

# Dropout Effect on Features

# Dropout Effect on Sparsity

In a good sparse model, there should only be a few highly activated units for any data case. Moreover, the average activation of any unit across data cases should be low.

# Comparisons with Other Regularization Methods

- Dropout is more effective than other standard computationally inexpensive regularizers, such as weight decay, filter norm constraints, and sparse activity regularization
- Dropout may also be combined with other forms of regularization to yield further improvement
- Although dropout alone gives significant improvements, using dropout along with [[Max Norm Constraints／Regularization|max norm regularization]], large decaying learning rates, and high momentum provides a significant
  boost over just using dropout.
