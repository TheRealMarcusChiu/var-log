###### Maxout Unit Activation Function

```excerpt
- is a generalization of the [[Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Activation Function|ReLU]] and the [[Leaky ReLU|leaky ReLU]] functions
- it is a piecewise linear function that returns the maximum of the inputs, designed to be used in conjunction with [[Dropout - Dilution - DropConnect (ANN)|dropout]]
	- $f(x) = max(w_1^Tx + b_1, w_2^Tx + b_2)$
- the main drawback of Maxout is that it is computationally expensive as it doubles the number of parameters for each neuron
