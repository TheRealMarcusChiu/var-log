###### (Receptive Field - Field of View) - Effective Receptive Field (ERF) - Theoretical Receptive Field (TRF)

```excerpt
- refers to the region of the input image that a particular neuron in a convolutional layer is “looking at” or taking into account when making its predictions or feature extractions
- is determined by the size of the convolutional kernel (also known as the filter) and the stride used during the convolution operation
- two types of receptive fields:
	- theoretical receptive field - theoretically evenly spaced out across the entire image
	- effective receptive field - in CNNs it is usually more centered of the image

Evaluating the receptive field in CNNs empirically is ERF.

While the TRF depends on the architecture only, the ERF dy/dx is dependent on the input, i.e., different inputs generate different ERFs dy/dx

The ERF both follows a [[Univariate Normal／Gaussian／Gauss／Laplace-Gauss﻿ Distribution／Model／Process (Bell Curve)|Gaussian distribution]] and occupies only a fraction of the full TRF
