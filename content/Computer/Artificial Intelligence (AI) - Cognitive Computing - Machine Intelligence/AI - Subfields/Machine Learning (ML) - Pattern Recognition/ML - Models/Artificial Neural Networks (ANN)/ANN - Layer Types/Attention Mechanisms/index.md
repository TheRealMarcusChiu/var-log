###### Attention Mechanisms

```excerpt
- mimics cognitive attention
- Attention was introduced to address the problem of long sequences in Machine Translation, which is also a problem for most other [[Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Computational Linguistics|NLP]] tasks as well
- in broad terms, attention is one component of a network’s architecture, and is in charge of managing and quantifying the interdependence:
	- between the input and output elements (General Attention)
	- within the input elements (Self-Attention)
- in technical terms, it calculates "soft" weights for each [[Word Embeddings／Embedding|word embedding]] in the context window of a text document
	- it can be done either in parallel (such as in [[Transformer Neural Networks (TNN) - Transformers|transformers]]) or sequentially (such as in [[Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)|recurrent neural networks]])
	- "soft" weights can change during each runtime, in contrast to "hard" weights, which are pre-trained and fine-tuned and remain frozen afterward

For [[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Translation／Translational／Shift Equivariant／Equivariance／Invariant／Invariance CNN|convolutional neural networks]], attention mechanisms can be distinguished by the dimension on which they operate, namely:

  "rows": [

        "content": "Spatial Attention",
        "bg": "#F4F5F7"

    ],
    [
      {

        "bg": "#F4F5F7"

      ""
    ],

      },
      ""
    ]
