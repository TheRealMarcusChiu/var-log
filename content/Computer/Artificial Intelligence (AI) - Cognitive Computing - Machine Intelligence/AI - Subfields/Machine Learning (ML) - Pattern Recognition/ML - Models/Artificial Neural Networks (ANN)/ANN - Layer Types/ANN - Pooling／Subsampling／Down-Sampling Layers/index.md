###### Pooling/Subsampling/Down-Sampling Layers
````excerpt
- reverse of [[ANN - Up-Sampling Layers|up-sampling layer]]
- is a form of non-linear down-sampling
- it partitions the input image into a set of rectangles and, for each such sub-region, outputs the maximum
- in a [[Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) - Translation／Translational／Shift Equivariant／Equivariance／Invariant／Invariance CNN|CNN]] architecture, it is common to periodically insert a pooling layer between successive [[ANN - Convolutional Layer|convolutional layers]] (each one typically followed by an [[Activation Functions (AF)|activation function]], such as a [[Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) Activation Function|ReLU]] layer)
- reduces the size of [[Feature Maps - Activation Maps|feature maps]] (i.e. the output of a [[ANN - Convolutional Layer|convolution layer]])
- grants a degree of local translational invariance to the features contained therein, allowing the CNN to be more robust to variations in their positions
- while pooling layers contribute to local translation invariance, they do not provide global translation invariance in a CNN, unless a form of [[Global Pooling Layer|global pooling]] is used
