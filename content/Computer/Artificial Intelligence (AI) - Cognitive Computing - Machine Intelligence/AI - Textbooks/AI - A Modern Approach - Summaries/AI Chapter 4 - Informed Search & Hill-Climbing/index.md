# Best-First Search

- idea: expand "best" node according to the <em>evaluation function</em> f(n)
- types of best-first search algorithms
  - greedy search
  - A\* search

### Types of Cost Functions

- <strong>heuristic function</strong>
  - h(n) = estimated cost from state <em>n</em> to a goal state
  - <strong>admissible heuristic function</strong>
    - h(n) = estimated cost from state <em>n</em> to a goal state that <em>never overestimates</em> the true cost
- <strong>total cost function</strong>
  - g(n) = cost from initial state to state <em>n</em>
- <strong>combined cost function</strong>
  - f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
  - f(n) = estimated cost of the cheapest solution through <em>n</em>

# Greedy Search

- idea: expand node based on <em>heuristic function</em> h(n)
- like depth-first search where it follows a single path towards goal and backs up when reached dead end
- not optimal & incomplete

# Uniform-Cost Search

- idea: expand node based on <em>total cost function</em> g(n)
- optimal & complete
- but can be very inefficient

# A\* Search

- idea: expand node based on f(n) where <em>f(n) = g(n) + h(n)</em>
- optimal & complete if h(n) is a <em>admissible heuristic</em>
- <strong>monotonicity</strong>
  - an attribute of f(n) that along any path from root, the f-cost never decreases
  - holds true for almost all admissible heuristics
- <strong>non-monotonicity</strong>
  - example: let's say state <em>n</em> is the parent of <em>n'</em>, a non-monotonicity heuristic is when f(n) > f(n')
- <strong>non-monotonicity to monotonicity</strong>
  - <strong>pathmax</strong> equation - f(n') = max(f(n), g(n') + h(n'))

# Heuristic Functions

- <strong>Effects of Heuristic Accuracy and Performance</strong>
  - <strong>effective branching factor</strong> b\*
    - if number of nodes expanded by A\* is <em>N</em> and solution depth is <em>d</em>
    - then b\* is the branching factor that a uniform tree of depth <em>d</em> would have to have in order to contain <em>N </em>nodes
    - thus, N = 1 + b\* + (b\*)² + ... (b\*)ᵈ
    - e.g. if A ⃰ finds a solution at depth 5 using 52 nodes, then b\* = 1.91
  - <strong>dominates</strong>
    - h2 dominates h1 if A\* using h2 expands fewer nodes
  - hence, it is always better to use heuristic function with higher values, as long as they don't overestimate
- <strong>Inventing Heuristic Functions</strong>
  - problem: finding the best heuristic
  - <strong>relaxed problem</strong> - a problem with less restrictions on the operators
  - <strong>composite heuristic</strong>
    - if a collection of heuristics contains no single dominating heuristic, we could define
    - h(n) = max(h1(n), ..., hₓ(n))
  - <strong>features</strong>
    - selecting and weighting the possible <em>features</em> of a state in order to evaluate the heuristic function

# Heuristics For Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)

- <strong>constraint satisfaction problems</strong> consists of:
  - a set of variables that can take on values from a given domain
  - a set of constraints that specify properties of the solution
- <strong>Choosing Next Variable to Assign Value</strong>
  - <strong>most-constrained-variable heuristic</strong>
    - used with forward checking
    - variable with fewest possible values is chosen to have value assigned
  - <strong>most-constraining-variable heuristic</strong>
    - assign value to variable that is involved in the largest number of constraints on other unassigned variables
- <strong>Choosing Value to be Assigned to Variable</strong>
  - <strong>least-constraining-value heuristic</strong>
    - choose value that rules out the smallest number of <em>values</em> in variables connected to the current variable by constraints

# Memory Bound Search

- <strong>Iterative Deepening A\* Search (IDA\*)</strong>
  - similar to regular <em>iterative deepening</em> from chapter 3
  - a depth-first search modified to use f-cost limit
  - optimal and complete
  - has some difficulties in certain problem spaces that can be traced back to using too little memory
- <strong>Simplified Memory-Bounded A\* Search (SMA\*)</strong>
  - makes use of all the available memory to carry out search
  - SMA ⃰ has the following properties
    - will utilize whatever memory is made available to it
    - avoids repeated states as far as its memory allows
    - is complete if available memory is sufficient to store the shallowest solution path
    - is optimal if enough memory is available to store the shallowest optimal solution path. otherwise, it returns the best solution that can be reached with the available memory
    - when enough memory is available for the entire search tree, the search is optimally efficient
  - when space runs out, drop nodes that are <em>unpromising</em>

# Iterative Improvement Hill-Climbing Algorithms

- <strong>Hill-Climbing Search</strong>
  - general idea: start with a complete configuration and to make modifications to improve its quality
  - make moves in direction of increasing value. It does not maintain a search tree, and it does not look beyond the immediate neighbors of the current state.
  - Hill climbing is often called "greedy local search" because it grabs a good neighbor state without thinking ahead about where to go next
  - 3 drawbacks:
    - local maxima - algorithm would halt thinking it is the global maxima
    - plateaux - search would conduct random walk
    - ridges - steep sloping sides
  - variants of hill-climbing algorithms
    - <strong>stochastic hill-climbing</strong>
      - chooses at random from the uphill moves, the probability of selection can vary with the steepness of the uphill move
    - <strong>first choice hill climbing</strong>
      - implements stochastic hill climbing by generating successors randomly until one is generated that is better than the current state
    - <strong>random-restart hill-climbing</strong>
      - conducts a series of hill-climbing searches from random initial states
      - can use a fixed number of iterations or continue until the best saved result no longer improved for a certain number of iterations
- <strong>Simulated Annealing</strong>
  - general idea: to escape local maxima allow search to take downhill steps

# Iterative Improvements in Constraint Satisfaction Problems

- <strong>heuristic repair</strong>
  - assign values to all variables, then apply modifications to move towards solution
- <strong>min-conflicts heuristic</strong>
  - select value that results in the minimum number of conflicts with other variables
