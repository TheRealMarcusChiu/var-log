### Terms

- <strong>knowing/knowledge</strong> - facts and rules
- <strong>knowledge base</strong> - a collection of <em>sentences</em> or representations of facts about the world
- <strong>background knowledge</strong> - initial <em>knowledge base</em>
- <strong>sentence</strong>
  - an individual representation, expressed in a language called <em>knowledge representation language</em>
  - types of sentences:
    - <strong>valid</strong>
      - a sentence is valid iff it is true in all possible interpretations and all possible worlds
      - also called
        - necessarily true sentence
        - analytic sentences
        - tautologies
    - <strong>satisfiable</strong>
      - a sentence is satisfiable iff it is true in some interpretation in some world
    - <strong>unsatisfiable</strong>
      - a sentence is unsatisfiable iff it is never true in any interpretation in any world

# A Knowledge-Based Agent

- a knowledge-based agent can be described in 3 levels:
  - <strong>knowledge level</strong> or <strong>epistemological level</strong> - the most abstract level of what it knows
  - <strong>logical level</strong> - the level which knowledge is encoded into sentences
  - <strong>implementation level</strong> - the level which there are physical representations of sentences

# Knowledge Representation Language & Reasoning - Logic

- <strong>Knowledge Representation Language</strong>
  - the goal is to express facts in computer-tractable form
  - <em>knowledge representation language</em> is defined by 2 aspects
    - <strong>syntax</strong> - physical patterns stored in computer
    - <strong>semantics</strong> - the meaning of syntax
  - difference between <em>facts</em> and their <em>representations</em>
    - <em>reasoning mechanisms</em> must operate on <em>representations</em> of <em>facts</em> rather than <em>facts</em> themselves
  - types of languages
    - languages used for knowledge representation (an agent's internal knowledge)
    - languages used for communication with other agents (such as natural languages)
  - a good <em>knowledge representation language</em> should combine the advantages of <em>natural</em> and <em>formal</em> languages
  - <strong>semantics</strong>
    - a <em>sentence</em> does not mean something by itself
    - most languages are <em>compositional</em> - the meaning of sentences is a function of the meaning of its parts
- <strong>Reasoning or Inference</strong>
  - <strong>reasoning/inference</strong> - the process of reaching to a conclusion
    - <strong>logical inference</strong> or <strong>deduction</strong> - sound reasoning
  - <strong>entailment</strong> - the generation of <em>valid</em> sentences, given <em>background knowledge base</em>
  - <strong>inference procedure</strong> - the steps to derive a sentence <em>a</em> from <em>knowledge base</em>
  - <strong>proof</strong> - the record of operation of a sound <em>inference procedure</em>
  - <strong>complete inference procedure</strong> - the ability to find a proof for any <em>sentence</em> that is entailed
- <strong>Logic</strong>
  - logic consists of 2 things
    - a formal system for describing states of affairs, consisting of:
      - syntax of the language - which describes how to make <em>sentences</em>
      - semantics of the language - which states the systematic constraints on how sentences relate to states of affairs
    - the proof theory - a set of rules for deducing the entailments of a set of sentences
  - properties of logic:
    - <strong>monotonicity</strong> - logic is monotonic, if <em>KB1 ⊨ a then (KB1 ∪ KB2) ⊨ a</em>
  - kinds of logic:
