###### Reactive Programming Paradigm (Dataflow)

- type of [[Declarative Programming Paradigm|declarative programming paradigm]] concerned with [data streams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stream_\(computing\)) and the propagation of change
- with this paradigm, it is possible to express static (e.g., arrays) or dynamic (e.g., event emitters) <em>data streams</em> with ease, and also communicate that an inferred dependency within the associated <em>execution model</em> exists, which facilitates the automatic propagation of the changed data flow

# Example

In an [<em>imperative</em> programming](http://confluence.marcuschiu.com/display/NOT/Imperative+Programming) setting:

- 𝐴 = 𝐵 + 𝐶 would mean that 𝐴 is being assigned the result of 𝐵 + 𝐶 in the instant the expression is evaluated, and later, the values of 𝐵 and 𝐶 can be changed with no effect on the value of 𝐴

In [<em>reactive</em> programming](http://confluence.marcuschiu.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=381224):

- the value of 𝐴 is automatically updated whenever the values of 𝐵 or 𝐶 change, without the program having to re-execute the statement 𝐴 = 𝐵 + 𝐶 to determine the presently assigned value of 𝐴
