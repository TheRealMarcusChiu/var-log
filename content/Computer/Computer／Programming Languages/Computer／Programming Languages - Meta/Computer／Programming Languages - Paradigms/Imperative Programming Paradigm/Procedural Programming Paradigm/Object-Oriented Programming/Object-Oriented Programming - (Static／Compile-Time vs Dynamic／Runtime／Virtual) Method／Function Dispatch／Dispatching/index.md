# 2 Forms of Dispatch

- <strong>static dispatch</strong> - is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation (method or function) to call during <strong>COMPILE TIME</strong>
- <strong>dynamic dispatch</strong> - is the process of selecting which implementation of a polymorphic operation (method or function) to call at <strong>RUNTIME</strong>

# Advantages of dynamic dispatching

- Develop plug-ins for existing products. No need to recompile the portion of code that relies on the dynamically bonded code
- Create loosely coupled components that are easily unit tested
- Present the same interface by using different implementations (polymorphism)
