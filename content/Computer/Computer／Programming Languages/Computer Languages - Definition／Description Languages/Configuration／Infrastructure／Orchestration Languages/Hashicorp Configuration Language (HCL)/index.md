<strong>Hashicorp Configuration Language (HCL)</strong>

- is used by [[Terraform]] uses to express infrastructure

# For Example

```
resource "aws_instance" "hello" {
  ami = "<ami-id>"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

In this example, we are declaring a terraform resource of type <code>"aws\_instance"</code> with name <code>"hello"</code>
