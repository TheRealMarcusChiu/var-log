# 1 - Testing Neo4j Methods

- Neo4j's Test Harness
- [[Java - Neo4j - Embedded|Neo4j's Embedded]]
- [[Java - TestContainers|TestContainer]]'s Neo4j Module

# 2 - Comparisons

Using Harness and/or the Neo4j's Embedded requires adding dependencies. This inevitably pollutes the test classpath leading to various issues, for example

- having conflicting versions of libraries on the classpath (the culprits are usually Lucene, Jetty or Scala), see for example [<em>this issue</em>](https://github.com/neo4j/neo4j/issues/10238)
- Spring auto-configuration is affected by presence of certain classes on classpath
- non-determinism - your code either sometimes fails, or fails only in certain environments
