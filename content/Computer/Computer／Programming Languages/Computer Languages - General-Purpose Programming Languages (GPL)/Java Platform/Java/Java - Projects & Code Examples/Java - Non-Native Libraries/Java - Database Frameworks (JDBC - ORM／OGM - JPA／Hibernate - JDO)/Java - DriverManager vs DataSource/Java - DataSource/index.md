A <code><strong>DataSource</strong></code> is a factory for connections to any physical data source. An alternative to the <code>[[Java - DriverManager|DriverManager]]</code> facility. It uses a URL along with some credentials to establish a database connection.

An object that implements the <code><font style="color: rgb(128,128,128);">javax.sql.DataSource</font></code> interface will typically be registered with JNDI service and can be discovered using it’s JNDI name.

A datasource may be used to obtain:

- standard <code>Connection</code> object
- connection which can be used in connection pooling
- connection which can be used in distributed transactions and connection pooling
