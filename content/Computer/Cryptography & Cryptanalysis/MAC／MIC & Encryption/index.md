```excerpt
utilizing both:
- [[Message Authentication Code (MAC) - Message Integrity Code (MIC)|MAC/MIC]] or [[Hash-Based Message Authentication Code (HMAC)|HMAC]] - is a short piece of info used to provide <em>authentication</em>/<em>integrity</em> of a message
- [[Encryption|encryption]] - is encoding a message to provide <em>confidentiality</em>

# Orders of MAC & Encryption

- <strong>Encrypt-then-MAC</strong> is the most ideal scenario. Any modifications to the cipher-text that do not also have a valid MAC code can be filtered out before decryption, protecting against any attacks on the implementation. The MAC cannot, also, be used to infer anything about the plain-text
- <strong>MAC-then-Encrypt</strong> and <strong>Encrypt-and-MAC</strong> both provide different levels of security, but not the complete set provided by <strong>Encrypt-then-MAC</strong>

Theoretical, of course, but a less than ideal scenario. This occurs if the plain-text messages are repeated, and the MACed data does not include a counter (it does in the SSH 2 protocol, but only as a 32-bit counter, so you should take care to rekey before it overflows).",

Assuming the MAC shared secret has not been compromised, we ought to be able to deduce whether a given cipher-text is indeed authentic or has been forged; for example, in public-key cryptography, anyone can send you messages. EtM (Encrypt then Mac) ensures you only read valid messages.\n- If the cipher scheme is malleable we need not be so concerned, since the MAC code will filter out this invalid cipher-text.\n- The MAC does not provide any information on the plain-text since, assuming the output of the cipher appears random, so does the MAC. In other words, we haven't carried any structure from the plain-text into the MAC code.",
