###### Computer Organization - Microarchitecture (µarch - uarch)

```excerpt
- sometimes abbreviated as <em>µarch</em> or <em>uarch</em>
- is the way a given [[Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)|instruction set architecture]] is implemented in a particular [[Processor - Processing Unit (PU) - Processing Element (PE)|processor]]
