###### Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipelined Stages (MIPS) Architecture

- is a family of [[Reduced Instruction Set Compute／Computer (RISC)|reduced instruction set compute (RISC)]] instruction set architectures (ISA)
- developed by MIPS Computer Systems, now MIPS Technologies, based in the United States
- is a <strong>load/store architecture</strong> (also known as a register-register architecture); except for the <strong>load/store instructions</strong> used to access memory
- all instructions operate on the registers

# MIPS - Pipeline

MIPS has 5 stages in pipeline instruction execution

- <strong>fetch</strong> - pull the instruction from RAM into the processor
- <strong>decode</strong> - determine the type of the instruction and extract the operands (e.g., the register indices, the immediate value, etc)
- <strong>execute</strong> - if necessary, perform the arithmetic operation that is associated with the instruction
- <strong>memory</strong> - if necessary, read or write a value from/to RAM
- <strong>writeback</strong> - if necessary, update a register with the result of an arithmetic operation or a RAM read
