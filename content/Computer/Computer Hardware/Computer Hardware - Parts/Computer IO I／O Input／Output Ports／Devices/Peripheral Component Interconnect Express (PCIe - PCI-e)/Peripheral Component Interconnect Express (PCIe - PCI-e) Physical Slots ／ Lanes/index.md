###### Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe - PCI-e) Physical Slots

```excerpt
- uses the [[Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe - PCI-e) Specification／Interface|PCIe specification]]
- are expansion slots found on a computer's [[Motherboard (MoBo)|motherboard]]
- they allow additional hardware components to be connected to the computer, such as graphics cards, sound cards, network cards, and other peripherals

      "A lane is composed of two pairs, with one pair for receiving data and the other for transmitting. Thus, each lane is composed of four wires.\n\nPhysical PCIe links may contain 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, or 32 lanes."

- consumer CPUs will typically allow for 16 to 24 PCIe lanes
- higher-end CPUs will typically allow for 64 or more PCIe lanes
