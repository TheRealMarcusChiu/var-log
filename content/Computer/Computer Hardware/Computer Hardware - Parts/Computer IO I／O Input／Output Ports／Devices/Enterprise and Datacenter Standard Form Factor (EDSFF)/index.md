      "- is a form factor that was developed to maximize capacity per drive and per rack unit in a 1U server or storage array (JBOD, JBOF), with superior manageability, serviceability, and thermal characteristics vs traditional form factors that were designed for rotating media\n- there are options for x4 or x8 lanes of PCIe while fitting vertically in a 1U chassis to allow for scalable bandwidth per drive, as well as options for 9.5 or 18mm heat sinks for various power and thermal environments (25W and 40W respectively)\n- it improves data center serviceability, and is designed to be hot pluggable and front access serviceable with LEDs built into an integrated enclosure"

      "- is a flexible, power-efficient building block for hyperscale and enterprise compute nodes and storage, as well as for Compute Express Link (CXL) memory modules\n- the M.2 110mm form factor was popular in hyperscale data centers due to its low-cost structure, flexibility, and scalability of multiple drives per server. However, it faced challenges in terms of hotplug/serviceability, thermals and overheating, and scaling to high capacities\n- E1.S addresses these issues while maintaining a small form factor. It is slightly longer but wider than M.2, designed to accommodate more media (NAND) packages for increased capacity per drive. It fits vertically in a 1U chassis, similar to E1.L, enhancing serviceability and cooling efficiency"

      "- EDSFF E3 is a family of form factors designed to update and replace the traditional U.2 2.5-inch form factor in servers and storage systems\n- the different versions share the same height (76mm), and have commonality in length (112.75mm and 142.2mm) and width (7.5mm and 16.8mm)\n- these hot-pluggable drives are designed more optimally for flash density of the SSD and system chassis\n- the E3 family connector is designed for x4 to x16 PCIe lanes and power envelopes up to 70W\n- all versions should be slot/connector compatible and are designed to be front accessible\n- designed for future servers and storage systems, EDSFF E3 will accommodate next generations of PCI Express and can accommodate device types such as GPUs and NICs"
