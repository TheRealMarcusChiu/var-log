For instance, DDR400 memories work at 400 MHz at the most, DDR2-800 can work up to 800 MHz, and DDR3-1333 can work up to 1,333 MHz\n- It is important to note that this is not the real clock speed of the memory\n- The real clock of the DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 memories is half of the labeled clock speed. Therefore DDR400 memories work at 200 MHz, DDR2-800 memories work at 400 MHz, and DDR3-1333 memories work at 666 MHz"

This was later changed to the peak data transfer rate in Mbps, so memory that is classified as PC5300 has a peak data transfer rate of 5300 Mbps\n- is the standard used to classify memory modules\n- The second number, PC-xxxx, indicates the maximum transfer rate that the memory reaches, in MB/s.\n\t- DDR400 memories transfer data at 3,200 MB/s at the most, and hence they are labeled as PC3200\n\t- DDR2-800 memories transfer data at 6,400 MB/s and they are labeled as PC2-6400\n\t- DDR3-1333 memories can transfer data at 10,664 MB/s and they are labeled as PC3-10600 or PC3-10666\n- As you can see, we use the number “2” or “3” after “DDR” or “PC” to indicate that we are talking about a DDR2 or DDR3 memory, not DDR"
