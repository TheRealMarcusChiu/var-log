###### <strong>Master Boot Code</strong>

- is usually referred to as a [[Boot Loader - Boot Manager|Boot Loader]]
- resides within the [[Master Boot Record (MBR)|Master Boot Record]]
- its goal is to find the bootable [[Partition／Volume - Disk Partitioning - Partition Schema|partition]] and transfer execution to it. To find the bootable partition the following checks must occur:
  1. search for a bootable partition within the [[MBR - Master Partition Table|Master Partition Table]] (where the partition status is 0x80 for "Bootable")
  2. checks that no other partitions are marked as bootable within the [[MBR - Master Partition Table|Master Partition Table]]
  3. if partition is the only bootable partition, then the master boot code will read the partition's [[Partition／Volume Boot Record／Sector (VBR)|Volume Boot Record]] (first sector, 512 bytes, of the partition) and transfer CPU execution to that memory address
