###### Master Partition Table

- resides in the [[Master Boot Record (MBR)]]
- is a 64 byte structure made up of 4x16 byte partition entries
- the fixed size of the partition table limits the [[Operating Systems (OS)|OS]] to 4 partitions, but modern OS have built in the capability for many more partitions through a concept called extended partitions

Master Partition Table is the last 64 bytes of the MBR

These values appear on the disk as 3 bytes: FE FF FF\n- the three bytes representing the CHS address are broken up:\n\t- cylinder value is 10 bits (1024)\n\t- head value is 8 bits (256)\n\t- sector value is 6 bits (64)\n- this CHS addressing scheme allows for a maximum addressable size of:\n\t- 1024×256×63 \\* 512 = 8.4GB = 7.8GiB (using 512 byte sectors)"
