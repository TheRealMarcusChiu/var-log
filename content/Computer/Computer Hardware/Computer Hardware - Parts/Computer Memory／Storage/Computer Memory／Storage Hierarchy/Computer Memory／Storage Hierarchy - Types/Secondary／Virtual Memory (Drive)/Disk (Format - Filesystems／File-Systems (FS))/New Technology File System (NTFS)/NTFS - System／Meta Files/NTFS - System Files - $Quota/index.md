###### \$Quota

- a type of [[NTFS - System／Meta Files|NTFS System File]]
- is located in [[NTFS - System Files - $Extend|$Extend directory]] (on Windows NT was inode #9)
- tracks how much space on the volume is allocated by every user
- contains 2 indices:
  - \$O contains an entry for everyone that has a quota enforced on them
  - \$Q has an entry for every user login on the system
- when a file is accessed:
  1. a lookup is done in \$O for the file owner to see if they have a quota
  2. a lookup is done in \$Q to see what the quota is
