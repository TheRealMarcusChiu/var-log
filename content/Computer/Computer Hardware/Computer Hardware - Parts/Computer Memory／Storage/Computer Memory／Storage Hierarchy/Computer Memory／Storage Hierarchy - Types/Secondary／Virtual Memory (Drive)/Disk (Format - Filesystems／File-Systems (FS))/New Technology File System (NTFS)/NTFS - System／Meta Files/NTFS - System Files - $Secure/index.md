###### \$Secure

- a type of [[NTFS - System／Meta Files|NTFS System File]]
- inode #9 in \$MFT
- contains:
  - index for every file owner, \$SII Standard Information ID
  - index pointing to the Access Control List (ACL), \$SDH Security Descriptor Hash
- in Windows NT, every file had a [[NTFS - File Attributes - $SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR|$Security_Descriptor]][[NTFS - File Attributes - $SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR|attribute]] storing this info. Since many files had the same values in this attribute, it was moved out to this file so that data wasn't replicated
