MAC times are stored in a number of place in an [[NTFS - MFT File Record／Entry|NTFS file entry]]:

- [[NTFS - File Attributes - $STANDARD_INFORMATION|$STANDARD_INFORMATION]] - timestamps are kept current
- \$FILE\_NAME - timestamps are outdated

File access time is the last time that the file was accessed in any way and has granularity of 1 hour (this prevents constant excessive update to the metadata)

Windows converts:

- local time to UTC time for storage
- UTC time to local time for display

Interpretation problems occur if disk is examined on a system with a different timezone setting
