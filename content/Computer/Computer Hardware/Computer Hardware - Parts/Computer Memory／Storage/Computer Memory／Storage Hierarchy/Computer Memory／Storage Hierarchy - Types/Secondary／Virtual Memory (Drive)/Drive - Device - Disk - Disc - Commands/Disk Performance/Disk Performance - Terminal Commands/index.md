# dd

dd will give you information on write speed.

If the drive doesn't have a file system (and <strong>only then</strong>), use <code>of=/dev/sda</code>.

Otherwise, mount it on /tmp and write then delete the test output file.

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=/tmp/output bs=8k count=10k; rm -f /tmp/output

10240+0 records in
