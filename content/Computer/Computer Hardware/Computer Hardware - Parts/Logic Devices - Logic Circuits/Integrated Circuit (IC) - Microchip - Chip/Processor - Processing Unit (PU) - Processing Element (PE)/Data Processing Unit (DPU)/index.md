###### Data Processing Unit (DPU)

- a specialized electronic circuit with hardware acceleration of data processing for data-centric computing
- differentiates itself:
  - from a CPU by a lack of a program counter (replaced with a data counter)
  - from a GPU by a [[Computer Organization - Microarchitecture (µarch - uarch)|MIMD]] architecture rather than a [[Computer Organization - Microarchitecture (µarch - uarch)|SIMD]] architecture (required as each request needs to make different decisions and follow a different path through the chip)
- can be either [[Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC)|ASIC]]-based, [[Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA)|FPGA]]-based or [[System on Chip (SoC) - System on a Chip|SoC]]-based
