- <strong>association</strong> - is a relationship between two objects (e.g. owners feed pets, pets please owners)
- <strong>aggregation</strong> or <strong>composition</strong> - are subsets/special-cases of association (e.g. a tail is a part of both dogs and cats)
  - <strong>aggregation</strong> implies a relationship where the child CAN exist independently of the parent (e.g. Class (parent) and Student (child). Delete the Class and the Students still exist)
  - <strong>composition</strong> implies a relationship where the child CANNOT exist independent of the parent (e.g. House (parent) and Room (child). Rooms don't exist separate to a House)
    - is a subset/special-case of aggregation
- <strong>generalization</strong> - uses "is-a" relationship (e.g. cat is a kind of pet)
- <strong>specialization</strong> - opposite of generalization
- <strong>realization</strong> - is a relationship between the blueprint class and the object containing its respective implementation level details
